I rarely write bad reviews, but my experience at Bep Hen was so frustrating that I have to warn others.

First, they DO NOT accept credit cards. This is extremely inconvenient for tourists in this day and age. To make matters worse, the nearest ATM was out of order. We almost couldn't pay our bill because we couldn't get cash. How is this acceptable for a popular restaurant?

Secondly, the seating management was terrible. We were told to sit outside and that they would call us when an indoor, air-conditioned table was available. Later, we saw with our own eyes that at least THREE indoor tables were cleaned and left empty, yet no one came to get us. If we hadn't gone inside to check, we would have been forgotten forever. This felt incredibly unfair and disorganized.

The food was okay, but the horrible payment situation and the unprofessional service completely ruined our meal. There are countless amazing Food options in Da Nang. Choose one that accepts cards and treats customers fairly.

This restaurant was a terrible experience! First, it's 2025, and they still don't accept credit cards? Even worse, the nearby ATM wasn't working. I almost couldn't pay because I couldn't withdraw money. It was so embarrassing!

Also, the seating arrangement was infuriating—they initially said there were no seats indoors and told us to wait for an air-conditioned table. Then, three tables opened up and we weren't called! If I hadn't seen it myself, I might have forgotten about it. This kind of discrepancy in treatment was truly disappointing.
Overall, the food was acceptable, but the poor payment methods and chaotic management completely detracted from the experience. I wouldn't recommend this place for tourists who need convenient payment or fair service; there are so many better options in Da Nang.",1,3,1,,Lunch,Chinese,10/2/2025,10/3/2025

The restaurant had a lovely, cute atmosphere.

I ordered something like deep-fried eggplant in a marinade, sweet and spicy stir-fried pork, soup, and rice.

The soup was on the lighter side.

The pork had a sweet and spicy soy sauce flavor that went perfectly with the rice! It lacked the spice of Taiwanese braised pork rice.

The eggplant was piping hot, likely because it'd been deep-fried. It was in a sweet but slightly spicy broth, so it felt like deep-fried eggplant in a marinade.

We arrived at 11:30, and soon after, a steady stream of customers, from tourists to locals, arrived for lunch, and the restaurant quickly filled up.

The staff were very friendly.

[Note] While the Google Maps overview says they accept credit cards, they only accept cash. Unfortunately, I didn't have any cash on me, so I asked the staff at the entrance for directions to the nearest ATM, but the one on the side that you turn left down the street from the restaurant was gone.",5,5,5,Dine in,Lunch,Japanese,9/26/2025,10/3/2025

If you're looking for the authentic Vietnamese and Da Nang flavors rather than the typical dishes, I recommend this place. Just as Korea offers more than just kimchi jjigae and sippangsal (pork belly), Vietnam and Da Nang offer a wide variety of flavors. The menu here is incredibly diverse.

From garlic-scented stir-fried shrimp to tender and flavorful braised pork, each dish exudes the warmth and familiarity of home.

Stepping into the restaurant feels like stepping back into the 1970s. Wooden furniture, old records, and yellowed photographs create a nostalgic and warm atmosphere. The restaurant entrance is hidden behind a lush green potted plant, making it easy to miss without careful observation.

With its authentic Vietnamese home-style cuisine and affordable prices, Bếp Hên has captivated not only locals but also international tourists. For locals, it's more than just a restaurant; it's a warm haven that holds memories. For travelers from far and wide, it's a wonderful stop to experience traditional Vietnamese home cooking, where every bite is imbued with the taste of home—that simple beauty.",5,5,5,Dine in,Lunch,Chinese,3/3/2025,10/3/2025

For the second time, it’s very hard to tell if it’s a misunderstanding or they tried to overcharge, so I give them the benefit of the doubt.

What I’m sure is that, for the first time, one staff very rudely told me that they don’t take card and it’s cash only, which is odd for places like this, and because the other staff was ok, I came for a second time. But the second time I paid in card with no issue.

1. Crowd control is bad, and people who were behind me managed to somehow get a queue number first. The people behind me in the cashier queue also managed to pay first.

2. The seats we got were on the third floor, and this made eating especially difficult when it was low chairs and low tables

3. Food was extremely disappointing. I ordered the braised pork, pickled fish in soup, tomato tofu, and stir fried morning glory.

Nothing was out of this world or even remotely close to that. Extremely ordinary flavours, and I’ve eaten at Tam Vi (a Michelin starred eatery which serves traditional food in Hanoi), and even while people already label that a tourist trap, I would consider that leagues above this place

Also 65,000 for a non chilled coconut is more expensive than more exclusive beach bars here

4. The way they gave out food was nonsensical. We got morning glory first, and followed by rice and I’m not sure how we are supposed to eat them singularly. I’m not expecting a world class experience but this was a dismay especially because the time they took to serve each dish was so long. They did apologise for that.",2,2,2,,,,10/3/2024,10/3/2025

I love all the retro n vintage stuff in there.  Old world charm.  We ordered too much - as usual - for 2 pax n 1 toddler. Must try is the stuffed eggplant. The portions were decent and the menu offerings were definitely different from the usual Vietnamese restaurants we've tried in Hoi An n Danang. Generally, the food has a light taste on the tongue n delightful. The herbs or seasonings are not overpowering.

Service was good,  just that sometimes it's hard to communicate but we all try to get by!",4,5,4,Dine in,Dinner,,10/3/2024,10/3/2025

Even though there were no customers, five dishes arrived in less than three minutes. Fast service isn't the restaurant's selling point; they all tasted bad.

The braised eggplant wasn't seasoned at all, and the braised pork was overcooked, salty, and tough. Just thinking about it makes me sigh.

I felt bad about wasting all that food, but I knew I'd regret it even more if I finished it, so I just got up and left. I want to commend myself for that.

I rented the entire place and ate there all by myself. I was worried it might be hot, so they turned on a fan right in front of me, and they were so kind.
The menu included both regular options and photos, so it wasn't difficult. When I was having trouble deciding what to order, they even offered recommendations with their fingers. I ordered morning glory and rice (it's not on the photo menu, but the regular menu says steamed rice for 15,000 won or something), and chicken with lemongrass and chili peppers. The amount of rice was really... served in a soup bowl. One order would be perfect for two people. It wasn't sticky rice, but rather rice that was soft and fluffy, so it was delicious (personal preference).
I was a little worried because I'd seen a few reviews saying the food was salty, but it was perfect for my taste, so I had a blast. I couldn't tell if the table had a teacup or a plate, so I just placed the chicken bones on top of my rice and ate them. The waiter kindly placed a bowl in front of me and told me to put the bones in it. Thank you. We were both a bit embarrassed. I laughed..

The fish was much harder, and not buttery and melts in your mouth like other restaurants.  I don’t think it was Chilean sea bass.  The grill mussels was a little over cooked.

Arrived Blue, sent back, arrived again very rare after being microwaved, sent back one more time and again arrived at a normal rare. 3 times and the kitchen could not cook their signature steak to a correct level.
The Shrimp Pasta equally very bland, arrived cold had to be sent back and was also microwaved. Only 1 small shrimp on the whole plate which was completely hard and way over cooked.
This is absolutely not fine dining.

When I message Sky View, they do reply you promptly.

Had to pay by credit card so that the reservation will be confirmed. I wasn't comfortable to email back my credit card details, thus on my arrival day, I came here to place a deposit.

However, they couldn't find my booking and I had to wait quite some time for them to confirm with their manager. Anyway after 30 minutes, everything was settled. I paid 50% deposit.

On the arrival day, the restaurant set up the place very beautifully. The whole area is small with maybe less than 10 tables.

Lack of communication between the manager and waitress cos she informed me that the wine is chargeable but when the manager messaged me, the person informed me that for more than 5 paying guest, they will give me a complimentary bottle.

There was a live band. Initially was very noisy but after a glass of wine, my family seems to be enjoying themselves.

The NYE 2022 dinner was a set meal. Choose the main either Wagyu or Salmon.

One of the Wagyu wasn't done as per informed. Medium. However it came out over cooked. Returned and same thing happened.

Overall the service was good and dinner was alright.

When I went to counter to pay, I noticed that the drinks counter was so messy. If this place is a fine dining place, they shouldn't allow any guest to view any messiness of the place.

Sad to say that I won't return as there are other options around the area. The whole bill came up to VND 8.5 million.",4,4,4,Dine in,Dinner,,10/3/2023,10/3/2025

So the food might seem better than it really was. Even so, I would only give this place 3*. This place was listed at 9th place in a food blog of places to eat at Đà Nẵng, which makes me question the food critic's pallette.

As always, I'll do a worst to best out of my dishes:

(4) Baked mussels with Italian cheese: this was a huge letdown. The mussel smelled, and the cheese lacked salt. The mussel also wasn't baked well. I would have liked different cheese to be used, salt the mussel and grilled it over charcoal or something. As the way it was, it wasn't good at all.

(3) Flamingo four types of meat: heck, get this for the presentation alone, see video. The portion is big, so I would order this for 2 people. As a side, we had potato wedges, which needed salt (ask the kitchen for rock salt), and the mashed pumpkin, which omg was delicious. The meat was overall underwhelming if you've gone to a Brazilian steakhouse before.

(2) Vegetables curry: I had very low expectations for this dish after the waitress told me it's a bit thick. It's similar to a bisque, thicker than Vietnamese style, but was thinner than Indian style. I would eat it like a bisque and just ignore the bread. The bread should be served warm, in my opinion, along with the starter bread and butter.

(1) Tie: Sunrise smoothie/ tropical smoothie. If you love to instagram, these smoothies are for you. They looked like they were disassembled pieces of the smoothies, and I loved it.

My review is based on my experiences previously.
Summer and the team are excellent hosts a tip for a fine dining experience having an offering of water whilst the guest is looking at the menu is a perfect start to a meal.
I found the story behind the food choices very conflicting western food has an established flavour profile from each country and not all flavours match,  the bread with pate and sauce were random and didn’t really make sense not sure why the combination was chosen - I don’t like bread before a meal as I find it too filling and it ruins the meal - our mains were really yummy and cooked to perfection the menu however doesn’t make sense as the flavours of pesto gnocchi and Japanese Tuna don’t really go together? Nor did the rest of the combinations on the menu. My daughter had lava Cake which was a big hit I had tiramisu as it’s a favourite of mine however it was a cold cake with chocolate not what I would call a tiramisu the appetiser of kombucha and butter mousse were lovely but just did not work with the meal. My review is based on my day 4 experience of dining in Vietnam whilst also critiquing the experience compared to my western viewpoint.
Fine dining for me is about the restaurant telling me a story - it can be about Travel, or highlighting local produce or establishing new flavour combinations, or just showing the competition who is the best.
Thankyou very much for hosting us and best wishes for a successful restaurant.",5,4,4,Dine in,Dinner,,10/3/2024,10/3/2025

Kitchen staff has no idea how to cook food and inventory also displays lack of professionalism; lower-grade ingredients.
I rather eat a banh mi at a street food stall which is probably safer as they are intelligent in inventory.
2mil/2 ppl

0) the tempura was only thing of good quality. Low oil - cooked fine. Tartar was good as well.
1) amateur staff presented a wrong bill and took forever to give the bill/change. Food took a long time to arrive even there were only 4 other customers.
2) had the foie gra and chicken salad: probably the worst salads I had in my life, chicken was hot - why do you put hot chicken  in a salad? Assuming you were copying caesar salad with your very fishy dressing, where else in the world is it served like this????
Foie gras of a low quality and was cooked in a weird way - it was ruined by the chefs. Why do you cook foie gras before serving??? Its great as it is, maximally put some acidic/sweet element to it, that's enough.
Salads were pertruding with oil making it uneatable
3) beef steak I had to return to the kitchen because they served old meat that was like gum. I left the restaurant after this as i do not intend to risk my health on amateur managers and chefs not knowing how to do inventory correctly.
4) cocktails were too sugary.
A solid 1/10 and all the reviews here are fake and paid through SEO.
Why do you simply not provide a good service of acceptable quality? 2mil for 2 ppl is on the higher end of Da Nang -  It's not that hard to make a simple salad and a steak - why do you even have gold plattered beef on the menu if you can't source non-old beef that isn't like gum in the texture?
Where do you have your honour as staff and management?
If you managed to do good service - I would come back again as there is a lack of good Western food - you would have scored a good customer that isn't afraid to tip large and is loyal. Your mismanagement is hurting you in the long run and this will end in you closing.

Edit: sure, show your pictures of your steaks.
I as a customer don't care about your outdated billing system. Its not normal to wait so long or mess so many things up - name any top restaurant or any restaurant in general in da nang which takes such long time, bet you can't. You clearly misunderstood - i was not saying you were cheating, just that it was completely unprofessional.
Given your comments about SEO, you must not know how things are done / or are trying to hide your misuse of it.  Rather than deflecting a review which will help your business run better - why not try improving? It's obviously a mismanagement from the staff.",1,1,2,,,,10/3/2024,10/3/2025

So we searched on Google for open restaurants and found this one. The lady that greeted us seemed confused and told us that we can only order until 10.30 so I said yeah that's fine we will decide right away and she was still confused like didn't want us to be there. So we ordered like 5 minutes later but the whole process was weird and we didn't feel welcomed there.  I mean I don't know if it's a cultural thing to not expect more guests during the last hour, but for me if a place closes at 11 it means that I can still walk in at 10.15. So the food arrived at like 10.35 and at 10.50 she told us that they are closing in 5 minutes and shes gonna pack our food (didnt even ask if we want it take away).

I came here for lunch, the first impression was the beautiful view, enthusiastic staff, affordable prices, and grilled cheese bread and house salad to eat while waiting for the main dish. Then there was a dish of pasta with cream sauce that I couldn't finish, so the manager and chef came out to ask if there was anything about that dish that didn't satisfy me. I just felt it wasn't what I usually eat so I didn't finish it, but it wasn't bad at all.

The meat selection is mediocre. It looks like it was prepared in grandma's kitchen. No tasty crust. The quality of the meat is mediocre.

I don't recommend the duck salad with lotus. A set of ingredients in a plate without sauce. Of the whole salad, only the meat was tasty.

Cheese plate - very tasty. I liked it. If they had just served her and wine, it would have been a wonderful dinner.

So if you go to this place, then only go to a bar. The price for drinks and Algol is quite reasonable.

The view is beautiful. Service is poor. The waiter, in the middle of ordering, simply turned around and left. Then he really came back, but the impression was ruined",3,3,4,Dine in,Dinner,Russian,10/3/2024,10/3/2025

952,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUMxd3NUZkh3EAE,11,Ha Do,1 review,1,a year ago,"I booked a table for 3 people for Christmas dinner. Here are some minus points after my experience:
1. The service is not as advertised: (1) The Christmas choir starts at 7:00, but we booked a table for 7:30 and did not see the people telling us the time to start singing; (2) Giving away hot wine, foreign guests saw that the restaurant brought it to them while their family was ""ignored""; (3) Christmas gifts for guests -> once again giving gifts to foreign guests who don't give gifts to their own table, reminding the staff that gift-giving time is over so they will ask ""please"" for one gift for my table 😒 (what the heck)
2. Guests are not allowed to try the wine first, so the restaurant pours it so they drink it. If I have feedback on the quality of the wine, the restaurant will not charge me for my glass because of my feedback, the guests at the other table will still be charged.
3. Food doesn't come out according to the dish, the cold weather makes the food cold and hard. Steaks and pizzas were cold and had to be reheated, and the restaurant's appetizer sandwiches were dry and hard
4. The restaurant has a view of both the sea and the city, but it has columns and an old-fashioned design, so it's not too impressive.
In short, 3 people with a bill of nearly 3 million (dessert was cut off because I was really frustrated with the above experience) is not worth it in my opinion.",3,1,2,Dine in,Dinner,Vietnamese,10/3/2024,10/3/2025

We had pasta and pizza for the kids, flambéed seafood and an Angus beef. Everything is of excellent quality and superbly prepared. The starter offered was also brilliant and fruit came free with dessert. Only the wine list was a bit lean, but the monthly recommendation was good for a low price.
The service and manager were very friendly and chatty.
A highlight is the view from the Skybar on the 21st floor.
We were here on a Monday evening and were the only guests and were therefore served and involved in conversations a bit too often.

Crispy Calamari
Lightly battered and calamari was cooked to perfection. Chipotle mayo was a nice touch. The only imperfection, the batter caught on a tad too much oil.

Seafood Tagliatelle
The servers were kind enough to remake a second portion as the first was too salty. The seafood were fresh and cooked to perfection. Shrimps and calamari had a slight smoky aroma and a nice bite and the morsels of fish were great as well. However, the marinara sauce lacked depth. Notably, fresh pasta was used in the dish but I wished it was al dente. Then again, the taste and texture profile could be adjusted for locals.

Crispy Pork Belly
The rind was leaning towards chewy than it was crispy, the meat was tough. Coconut rice cake was a tad undercooked, you can taste the raw grains of rice. Apple sauce was decent.

Overall, I generally think their seafood dishes will be a hit. They are fresh and cooked well. Servers are friendly, attentive and the atmosphere was cosy.",5,4,4,,Dinner,,9/3/2025,10/3/2025

I’m a solo diner and prefer to sit at the bar; their bar is full service. I appreciated the beer selection and the bartender correctly identified the better beer out of the 2 I was choosing between. The food is thoughtfully executed, with elements that were new to me and that I liked. Eg. The brûlée citrus with the calamari, the black sesame in the batter, the roasted chile skins that were julienned. They make a lot of items in house, which is why I picked this place to try out. The spinach and ricotta pasta was delicious; it had bite, but not chew, and the filling was well seasoned. The toasted pine nuts on top were a necessary and appreciated texture. I had to get extremely picky to find any faults, but consider these negligible: basil chiffonade lacked uniformity and the basil was a bit bruised, perhaps because the knife needed to be a bit more sharp? Pasta was a touch thick, but had excellent crimping technique, which is a skill I personally struggle with. The sauce could’ve been adhered or merried better with the pasta, maybe with a little bit of that pasta cooking water. The dish lacked acid. Again, super minor things, but I would have welcomed a lemon wedge or a touch of vinegar to lift that cream sauce a bit. After a few bites, it got a little heavy on the palate and I needed some relief. Overall fantastic meal-I would eat here again and I have in mind a couple more dishes I’d like to try.

Food:

We started with the cevice. Wow this was truely a great dish with well balanced flavors. Fried calamari also super fresh and not chewy. Then I had the grilled octopus. This was not prepared well by the chef. Really overcooked, and chewy like gum. The chef really messed it up because I do believe the octopus was fresh. Hope he reads the feedback. The other fish we ordered was cooked perfectly.

Ambiance:
Really nice decor and much love for the music playlist. This really added to the atmoshpere.

Staff:

Everything with a smile and all really attentive. But a bit too much. You don’t have the take away my plate 1 second after i’m done eating, while the other person is still eating. You don’t have to ask 5 seconds after that if I want a dessert. Guys it’s not fast good I am enjoying my evening at a really nice restaurant. I asked for some time between appetizer and Main course, specifically 30 mins. But it came 10 mins after finishing appetizers. Restaurant was not crowded.

I can't stop thinking about the fish dish we had and I want to come back if time allows. I highly recommend dropping by and visiting Fatfish for a delicious meal. It's not traditional viet food by any means, but I needed a break because we had been here for almost 2 weeks already and ate all of the viet dishes I wanted to eat.

We ordered a lot haha, at least I feel like we did. I personally didn't really like the chicken wings because the flavor was too sour, my boyfriend happily ate all of the wings though! So this was 100% a personal preference. I just wish it was more sweet than sour. I ordered the whole fish and my boyfriend got the pork belly, it was so good!!

We weren't particularly hungry, so my husband, daughter, and I ordered a seafood platter, three beers, and a juice. Before the seafood platter arrived, we were served our beers and a simple snack, like puffed rice cakes. The snacks were crunchy and had a nutty flavor thanks to the sesame seeds sprinkled on top, making them incredibly delicious. It was early, so most of the tables were empty, and despite the large staff, we had to wait a while for the seafood platter. I thought they were out catching seafood.
The food didn't smell like spices, so it was passable. We had a small lobster, three or four oysters, some fried squid, a large piece of fish, a few small scallops, and some stir-fried noodles. The food was average. It wasn't enough for a full meal, but more like a drink. One seafood platter, three beers, and a glass of juice cost 2 million dong (about 110,000 won). It didn't feel worth the price.

I would like to thank the Fatfish team for being incredibly hospitable to my friends and me during our dinner. I appreciate every single detail that was taken to ensure we felt special.

Now onto the food.

Starters

1) Fatfish Ceviche
Deconstructed to an incredibly pretty plate  to consist of acid, sweet & spicy and is something unique compared to a traditional ceviche.

2) Shortbread Duck
Admittedly it wasn’t very impressive looking but the flavours that hit straight on my first bite made me know that I was wrong. Sweet yet savoury definitely a good starter.

Mains

1) Spinach Ravioli
Probably my least favourite dish amongst the rest due to high calibre of flavours the rest had as this felt under seasoned. Great idea but execution of the sauce may need some work.

2) Mahi Mahi Fillet
Incredibly done, the perfectly seared skin and the fresh firm Mahi Mahi was superb. Resting on top of some grilled asparagus and what I can assume is a pumpkin purée spice the dish fit the billing as a popular dish. Asparagus however was a bit old.

3) Seafood Tagliatelle
My standout dish for the night, with a squid ink tagliatelle cooked into that sweet and perfectly spiced sauce. It was fantastic, topped with a lot of fresh seafood. I love it.

I’d give my time here an 8/10. With my only pointer is to build more dots between the guest and restaurant. Will be back when I’m back in Da Nang! Thanks team.",,,,,,,10/3/2023,10/3/2025

This was really bad customer service and a huge disappointment to Korean customers. Be careful of hairs in this restaurant.

Pro tip: although they serve bottled water, they also will serve you filtered water if you insist.

In terms of ambience, design is ok but they fall flat with the monotonous background muzac. Makes you feel like you’re in a mall more than in a restaurant. They missed the mark.

Nice touch, they serve you a complimentary flatbread at the start although neither the flatbread or the sauce had a discernible flavour.

Ordered cerviche, carpaccio, taco trio and salmon flatbread.

Cerviche was a total assault on the senses with no balance. It’s the perfect way to ruin your palate before eating anything else. There might be fish on the plate but you won’t be able to tell that it’s fish. Take a pass.

Taco trio seems just for show, meat was dry, large quantities though, overwhelming the somewhat dry tortilla. Similarly, I would pass.

Salmon flatbread missed the memo - the salmon was cooked to tastelessness.  Could have been tofu and had the same complexion and flavour. Perhaps the person executing has never actually tried this dish before. You don’t cook the salmon on the flatbread.

Finally the carpaccio was nice to look at. They had an attempt at a sweet tomato salsa to accompany which didn’t match. Cheese was the lowest cost hard cows cheese they could find, robbing the plate of appropriate richness. Would pass.

The best part of the dinner was the Savall Chocolates featuring local flavours. Pricy though, 185k.

Overall dinner came out to 1 million for one person.

Was I full? Yes.
Was I satiated? Not really. I went and ate Vietnamese noodle soup after.

Would I come back? I’m really not sure. I like the look of the place and maybe the bar top would be good for a date and some nibbles, but for a dinner where I’m looking for sustenance, nutrition and deliciousness, probably not.

In the end I fault the restaurant -2 points for being overpriced for its food category given the ingredients and execution. Design and ambiance does not make up for shortcomings in what the food should be.",,,,Dine in,Dinner,,10/3/2023,10/3/2025

____________________________________
Extremely bad service. They spilled the wine everywhere on the dinning table and even on the customers shirt and trousers. Yet, they didn't bother to apologize or offer laundry to customers. On top of that, they didn't even bother to change the spoiled tablecloth too. Am I supposed to happily fine-dine under such bad hygiene?

The food quality was also definitely not worth the monstrous price. Nothing special and the dishes tasted dull most of the time. But this could be due to my bad mood caused by their bad service. Anyway, I strongly recommend AGAINST this restaurant.",,,,,,,10/3/2023,10/3/2025

To think that a family of four could eat a meal for this amount in Vietnam... I felt like I'd been ripped off. I'd expected a fancy restaurant, but the interior was a bit flashy, but it was cramped and the chairs were hard and uncomfortable. Keep in mind that this isn't a restaurant for dinner, but a place for snacks. While it's certainly my fault for going there based on reviews, the food was salty and incredibly expensive. It was over four times the price of a typical Vietnamese restaurant. I'll just take the reviews as a guide... It's not Vietnamese food, so keep that in mind. This definitely doesn't deserve four and a half stars. I was shocked that a seafood dish in Vietnam cost over 60,000 won. The food was salty and lacked anything.

However, their food was 60% great and 40% average. We ordered the meat platter. We really loved the smokiness and flavorful taste of the duck, we were hoping for the pork belly to be more crispy or have more flavor and the brisket was served cold and flavorless. Then we ordered the salmon, which we requested medium well done and was served well done. The taste was ok. The highlight for us was really their home made ice cream. We ordered the pistachio and the Cookie's and cream flavor. They were fresh and very creamy. It reminded me of the Italian Gelato.

Very non pretentious entrance like walking off the beach into a bar in Costa Rica which opens into a bar / restaurant with beautiful decor. Obviously much though put into each detail.

Was offered the lunch menu available until 4pm and given the prices I thought it would be more of a snack. There were several options that sounded delicious and nothing over ten bucks. I went with the Mahi mahi sandwhich and was blown away at the massive piece of fresh fish I recieved. Went with the house made wedges (also have mediterainian salad and green salad options) and try as I did to finish I had to leave with two left on the plate.

A lot of great beer available but I went with the coconut shake. I work with a lot of breweries in Vietnam and drink it so often and well who doesnt love a coconut milkshake. Shake was great though pretty sweet.

Staff were wonderful. Chatty and attentative and big smiles.

Food:

Fish carpaccio: An interesting mix of ingredients which was very refreshing.  The combination of fruits with the fish complimented the fish.

Go between 4&6pm and have 2 for 1 drinks, cocktails and beer.

The beef and octopus carpaccio was sensational, the seafood tagliatelle......couldn't get enough of it...soooooo good.

We then ate the duck which is home grown literally as it comes from their own farm, same as the fish is supplied by their family as they are also fisherman.

In any case highly recommended,

The salmon steak was delicious. The rest of the menu didn't suit my taste. I paid just under 100,000 won, and a tip is not necessary; it's calculated separately.

However, because the grill couldn't maintain its temperature for long, it cooled quickly, and I ended up eating cold meat. Naturally, it became tougher as it cooled. It couldn't compare to the taste of meat eaten straight from the hot grill. Vietnamese customers who aren't familiar with Korean barbecue culture might enjoy it.

The grilled vegetables that took up the largest portion of the grill looked like they were just there to fill the table.

The kimchi pancake that was included in the set was quietly removed, apparently because they couldn't handle it. There was no explanation.

They advertised cold noodles or beer as an opening event, but as soon as I sat down, they started putting alcohol on the table, even though I didn't drink it. When I told them I didn't drink, they took it away. They could have replaced beer with another soda, but no cold noodles, no drinks... no options. Seeing that they didn't even give non-drinkers a choice, I felt they were inflexible.

Employee training is a key skill of the owner, but I was surprised to see him blame an employee in front of a customer when he was acting a bit awkward. He didn't realize it was spitting in his own face. ㅜ

When I paid, he didn't even ask how the food was, just a sullen expression on his face. I thought he was really bad at business. For a newly opened restaurant, he seemed incredibly unenthusiastic. I wonder if he wasn't curious about customer feedback.

It would be better to focus on the food selection and store management as much as he did on the interior and tableware.

The interior seems to have been carefully designed, and the ancillary services, like cold water and frozen wet tissues, are good. The only real concern is the food selection and customer service. The meat quality was decent, so it's truly disappointing.

I left this comment out of genuine frustration, but
it's even more disappointing that you don't even realize it's feedback. That's unfortunate.
I didn't just swear out of context.
You shouldn't be offended. Rather, I wonder why things weren't so good. Was it the food or the service? Most owners would have trouble sleeping because they're curious. Asking confidently and working to improve that area would be helpful in many ways. ^^",1,1,1,,,Korean,9/26/2025,10/3/2025

A combo includes a set of meat as shown in the picture, a portion of soup, rice, panchan and 2 small mineral water (500k) the price is suitable for the portion, 2 people have a lot of food left. This set can be finished by 3 people, but for those who eat a lot, 2 people will be full. The space is clean, cool, spacious, but I don't like the smell of the restaurant very much, sitting for a while will get used to it but still suggest that the restaurant should handle the smell a bit. Although the mineral water is provided by the restaurant, it would be more delicate if the restaurant served it with a glass, going on a date and holding a whole bottle of water to drink like that, girls will be a bit shy and uncomfortable. The food here is tasty and the portions are very generous by Vietnamese standards. The side dishes (panchan) didn't really stand out to me, but overall the set was good value. One combo includes a meat set (like in the photo), soup, rice, panchan, and two small bottles of water, all for 500k. Honestly, two people will already feel full, and if you're not a big eater, this amount could easily feed three.

The space is clean, spacious, and cool, but I personally wasn't a fan of the smell inside the restaurant. You get used to it after sitting for a while, but I think it’s something the restaurant could improve.

One small detail: although bottled water is complimentary, it would feel much more thoughtful if glasses were provided. Especially on a date, drinking straight from the bottle can feel a bit awkward for some people.",5,5,5,,Dinner,Vietnamese,9/3/2025,10/3/2025

The meat is grilled to perfection, so you can enjoy the meal without the usual BBQ smoke or smell.

I personally liked the part where the meat was grilled~~
Another thing I liked was that the meat was good, but I liked the soybean paste stew, kimchi roll noodles, and charcoal fried riceㅠㅠ
The moment I took a bite of the kimchi roll noodles, I was confused whether I was in Vietnam or Da Nang, Gyeonggi Province. It was so refreshing and delicious. I keep thinking about it even as I write😭😭😭
Oh, and since there is swine fever going around in Vietnam, I haven't been eating pork, but the biggest reason I went to Jagaljip was that they don't use Vietnamese pork!! (This is something I'm very sensitive about these days)
Anyway, the meat didn't smell, was soft, and was very similar to the pork belly I had in Korea~
I went in without much expectation, but I've decided to go here for pork belly from now on
I went at an ambiguous time, so I was able to talk to the owner, and he said that he runs Jagaljip in several places in Korea~ I'm going to go there when I go back to Korea

My younger sibling told me that it had just opened, so I went there. The interior was clean, and they gave me Tower beer as a special opening service, which was nice.
Aside from my dad, no one else was hungry, so we ordered one set with 800g of meat, and the four of us ate it, which was enough.
The only thing is that there is an additional charge for adding vegetables, which is different from Korea!
I could see that the owner of the restaurant was Korean, and he asked me in detail if I was okay after eating, and he was very attentive.
I regret not asking if the pig was Vietnamese mini pig.

The wine pairing with the food was exceptional. I just wish I knew what each drink was so I could indulge at a later stage. The sparkling and pilot noir were delightful sips to the dishes.

The decor was beautiful.

The canapes to start with were delicious.  The Tomato Gazpacho was summer in my mouth.
The Salami Fennel Bruschetta, divine and the bread ..... wow.
The Rainbow Beetroot Salad fresh and delightful with each bite I took. I especially adored the yoghurt dressing and hidden Gorgonzola.
The BBQ Squid and Wagyu Steak were executed beautifully and the twist on the classic Tiramisu Dessert a wonderful way to finish the meal.

Food

- We chose the 8-course signature menu. While most dishes were unexpectedly flavorful, the last three courses were mediocre. The ravioli had a well-seasoned filling, but the outside was too firm; an additional 30 seconds of cooking might have improved its texture. The spaghetti dish was disappointing, resembling standard spaghetti found at many restaurants. The final savory course, pan-seared pigeon with tamarind sauce, lacked the expected sourness, tasting predominantly sweet. However, I admit that the meat was perfectly cooked.

Service
- While the food was generally impressive, the service did not meet expectations, especially considering the premium pricing. Throughout the dinner, I wasn’t asked if i wanted another beer, and my water glass remained empty until I requested a refill multiple times. This lack of proactive service detracted from the overall dining experience. Thats why i gave it 4* but there is room for improvement.

Location
- The restaurant is off the grid but it only takes 15 minutes to get there from downtown.

Food: 2⭐️
Service: 2⭐️
I came to the restaurant with a friend and had booked a table for 2 people. When checking the table with the staff, the staff took me straight to a table right at the kitchen entrance in the lower area with no customers and very hotgggg. When I asked to change the table, the staff did not tell me that there was an air-conditioned room upstairs and all the customers were dining there. My friend had to go up and check and request a table change. While there was no full table upstairs and no table had a reserved table card. Second, the other tables (mostly Western guests) all brought out a bamboo basket for the guests to put their bags in, but our table did not.

About the food, I did not expect the best dish of the whole meal to be the restaurant's welcome food. Except for the tomato soup (exactly like crushed tomatoes), the 2 welcome dishes were delicious and unique. But why did you serve the starter with the welcome dish, while I ordered grilled squid as the starter, when I used the squid it was already cold, and a bit fishy. Do you understand the exact timing of serving each dish in turn, especially for fresh seafood dishes. The most important thing is that you combined fresh squid with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes that I thought were sweet potato pudding, were super sweetttt, and it didn't go well with the squid dish at all, it broke the entire texture of the dish, I was eating fresh squid, salty with black garlic and then eating a whole piece of sweet potato pudding that was both sweet and greasy with the smell of milk. It was too sweet to be served with a savory dish whether it was squid or chicken.

You are a restaurant specializing in European cuisine but you cook mashed potatoes like sweet potato pudding. You are so creative.

The food is normal, fresh, but not wow enough for the price I paid for you. It didn't leave any impression that made me remember and want to eat it again.
The last thing you do when you send emails asking for customer feedback is when you don't respond to customer feedback. My friend replied to your feedback request and waited for more than a week but still no response, sent again a second time and still no response. So do you respect your customers or not?",2,2,3,,,Vietnamese,9/3/2025,10/3/2025

I do not claim anything, I just want to share my thought. I made reservation for two, and we came on time. It was a very hot day in Da Nang (one of the hottest day), as you may experience. I am not sure why your staffs took us to an aisle seat downstair, without air condition. They did not advise that the restaurant has air condition room upstair. I must ask them if there is another table up stair, and I have to go to check by myself. How can we enjoy our dinner in such hot place. And I am really really disapointed since I have booked the table, I prepared from my end to enjoy your food, but you destroyed it.

We ordered 1 starter, two main courses, 2 deserts. I am not sure why you serve welcome bread as the same time with starter. We wait for while, and the a bunch of food is served. It does not make any sense for me.

From my point of view, the food is just fine for me, not so surprise. The only thing I can remember is the masked potatoes used in the main course because it is too sweet.

Thanks.",2,3,3,,,,9/3/2025,10/3/2025

It looks like it could be in Daikanyama, Tokyo, and is filled with tranquility, elegance, and sophisticated adult style.

Because of its ambiance, the main clientele seemed to be those on special dates like anniversaries or small dinner parties.

The local customers were dressed in their finest attire, and the international customers were all calm and composed, so you can enjoy your meal in a refined atmosphere.

I ordered the main dish a la carte, and my impression was that it was not particularly delicious, but rather had a smooth flavor.

Given the restaurant's reputation, price range in Da Nang, and the restaurant's appearance, expectations are likely to be high, so I think judgments of the food will vary.

The restaurant costs around 6,000 to 9,000 yen, which is very reasonable considering the ambiance, and the food is reasonable, in my opinion.

The wine menu is extensive and delicious, so I personally recommend focusing on enjoying the wine and enjoying the food as an accompaniment.

The service level is high, but although there are several wait staff, none of them have a full view of the entire restaurant, which can make ordering difficult.

The restaurant's relaxed atmosphere makes it difficult to call for staff.

I've written a lot, but I think this is the perfect place to forget you're in Vietnam, spend a special time in a stylish space, and enjoy some wine.

They said the portions were large enough for two people to share, so we shared dishes like Red Tail McKerell sashimi, lamb tartare with pecorino cheese, and LẠC SƠN chicken with black truffles. It seemed like a perfectly balanced portion for one person, but we still ended up full.

The food was delicious, but for a Japanese palate where fusion is the norm, there was nothing particularly new here. It felt like the chef's personal take on Italian, French, and Vietnamese cuisine.

The amuse-bouche was pickled vegetables, and the use of miso and other seasonings, along with the sashimi techniques, all had a strong Japanese influence, so perhaps that's why there weren't many surprises.

The food wasn't too expensive, but the wine was significantly more expensive than in Japan, so we opted for something on the cheaper side. It came to around 15,000-16,000 yen for two people, so unless that was your main focus, I wouldn't recommend it.

Of particular note are the excellent service and the layout of the store. Such attentive customer service is rare, not only in Vietnam but even in modern Japan, and the semi-open-air building, hidden amongst trees on the outskirts of a residential area, is definitely worth a visit.

The food was excellent and really tasty. We were 3 guests and we ordered a few starters and main courses to then be shared among us. Every dishes were pre divided in 3 plates and served to us. That was a really nice touch. The combination of Italian and Vietnamese flavours makes the food really special. For instance, the Ravioli filled with Gorgonzola cheese was enjoyed by all our table.

Chef Alessio Rasom’s menu reads like a love letter to both Italy and Vietnam—think imported cheeses and housemade pastas, but also Đà Nẵng’s own rau răm and Lý Sơn garlic woven into every dish.

Start with the Gambero Rosso Carpaccio: red prawn, sharp pecorino, a taste of summer on a plate. Or try the Snail & Abalone Salad with green apple and granita—a briny, bright snap for your palate. For mains, the Gnocchi Sweet Potato with tender lamb brasato is comfort food with a twist, while the Linguine Octopus with capers and olives brings a briny, Mediterranean punch.

Don’t leave without dessert. Whether it’s cloud-light Tiramisu or Cannoli Calamansi, each ending is as thoughtful as the start.

Pro tip: ask for a wine pairing—the sommelier knows every bottle’s story.

I missed it for a long time after I ate it last time
It can be said that I came back to Danang just for this restaurant.
The service is still meticulous and the food is even more amazing
I like it more than last time...

I tasted a lot of Taiwanese elements, such as pig blood, black garlic, and dried mushrooms.
The way it is integrated with the food is very novel
Every dish is eye-opening and amazing🥹
If you are not used to eating Western food
They have a Vietnamese flavor, which I think is quite similar to Taiwanese cuisine.

Four dishes, two desserts and two drinks cost about NT$2,600
Eat this meal in Taiwan
Such great taste and service
It might cost more than twice the price haha

A very satisfying evening!
Thanks again for this great restaurant 😍

Many of the dishes have unique and novel seasonings (there are some ingredients that are relatively rare in Asian cuisine). We really like the sauces and juices with mulberry and citrus, which are also super delicious!
The lobster and pigeon are great😍😍😍The taste and presentation of other meals are also outstanding~
I ordered two set meals, and one of the desserts was very considerate and allowed us to change it to a different item from the menu🥹. I highly recommend the tiramisu!!! It is a towel roll. The bitter chocolate outer shell and the cream inside are very refreshing and not burdensome.
Every service staff is friendly, professional, and very attentive. They will change the tableware, tidy up the table every two or three dishes, and will also ask if the taste is OK. There is a male waiter wearing glasses who carefully explains the preparation method, seasoning, eating method, and pairing wine every time he serves the dishes. Thank you very much!
When making the reservation, I made a special note that in order to celebrate the anniversary, I originally thought that the table would be decorated with bouquets, but I didn’t expect to receive a small cake🥺🥺🥺 and a complimentary glass of pairing wine for dessert (it was very sweet and delicious). It was such a surprise🫶I also kindly helped to take a group photo. I am very grateful for a very novel, rich and warm experience today🥰~

But when ordering pasta with lamb, you don’t expect any gristle on the stones in it. I thought my teeth were crunching. (not eaten in the photo) In general, it painfully reminded me of navy-style pasta with beef stew from a can. Those who remember will understand. But at a much higher price. Free welcome treats are fine. Thank you! Czech beer is also okay. The service is a bit intrusive. In general, everything is great here. But don’t set foot here again.
P.S. In response to the slander of the restaurant, I will say that I pointed to the plate right there and said that the food was no good, when an employee approached me and asked if I liked everything. No action was taken other than strange looks. Even at the time of my payment they just looked at me. No one gave even the slightest hint of a desire to understand (not even solve) the situation.
I brought the cartilage with me - you made my day. )))) And I brought stones. Before that, I had only seen this on TV, which I haven’t watched for twenty years. Good luck with this approach to things.
P.P.S.: Before this I doubted it. Perhaps this is the norm. And I even chewed the first cartilage. But now it has clearly become clear that cartilage and stones are not part of the dish. And someone's sloppiness.
P.P.P.S. There is no point in writing me pompous terms and names of ingredients. I described my taste sensations. For me, it's beef stew from a can.

(I visited because it had a Michelin star. However, it won't be awarded in 2025, and it's just a guide. Of course, that's a great thing.)

I knew the prices for the signature course and wine pairings were steadily increasing.

But when I visited in March 2025, the price of the course had also increased significantly, making it seem like a wasteful eight-drink pairing, making it less attractive compared to fine dining in Korea. Nevertheless, I made a reservation and ordered.

However, they were quite adventurous.

The food style was neither here nor there, a fusion of East and West, and completely unsatisfactory.

Unconventional ingredients. For example, pigeon meat and beef kidney.

The flavor of the ingredients was masked by sauce.

Let's just say it was an experiment.
So what about the wine pairings?

The wine was Vivino, priced in the 20,000-50,000 won range, which is a good value. They even gave me enough to fill just the bottom of my glass.

I was worried I'd get drunk after eight glasses, but...

I was like, ""How can you order three glasses in Korea?""

The pairing was expensive, so I considered ordering a bottle.

The wine list was quite good, so I was excited about the pairing, so I went with the pricey pairing...

How could I have been so disappointed?

The price was 250,000 won per person.

It had ingredients from Japanese cuisine and a delicate balance of flavors -- my salad had one piece of different kinds of fruit and vegetables that all lent their own sweetness, sourness, and bitterness. The little appetizers reminded me of mezze style eating in Turkey (you can ask for half size portions here, which I also do at mezze restaurants in Turkey).

Alessio Rason, the chef and co-founder, also garners high praise for his excellent Italian dishes using local ingredients and for innovative dishes such as pork belly flavored with cà cuống fish sauce. FYI cà cuống is a Vietnamese water bug that's prized as food and used to make fish sauce and essential oils.

To start, they give you complimentary snacks that set the expectation of the dining experience. The croissant with ham on it is brilliant but my personal favorite was actually the pickle radish. It was sweet and tangy - very refreshing.

We had the a la carte menu as the set seems to be a lot of food. The squid for starters was so nice. It is very tender and you can taste the char on it! For main, we got pigeon with foie gras and the lamb. Both of it has layers of flavor - we absolutely enjoyed it.

Perhaps because it had just been registered as a Michelin star, it wasn't very busy. However, the service and food were excellent, and perhaps because the chef had trained at a restaurant in Kyoto, they had dishes including tuna sashimi, which Japanese people would be thrilled to try.

There were many dishes that showcased the chef's creativity, and there was nothing lacking in taste/plating/service. 2 hours passed quickly, and I was so grateful to be able to eat a Michelin chef's dish🫢 The sashimi and mackerel pasta could have been fishy, but it was fresh and had a unique taste without any of that. The steak was medium rare, cooked just the way I wanted it, and the pumpkin sauce went really well with the steak🤤 The tiramisu cream that I ordered separately was so delicious that I ate it all up. The staff was also very kind, and I didn't have to think about other fine dining options. It's the best course that I will remember for a long time.",5,5,5,Dine in,Dinner,Korean,10/3/2024,10/3/2025

The complimentary bread course was elaborate and fantastic. The fish ball has a perfect crispy coating and mild, meaty fish inside. I also loved the shaved carrot pickles. The butter itself was special, spiced with with an exciting mix flavors.

The bruschetta was okay. it looked beautiful and the flavors were nice--the smoky eggplant especially--but I didn't feel like i was eating anything special. I wish it had more of a bite to it or another savory element. The bread was more like whole grain toast than bruschetta. Still yummy but wouldn't get again.

The barracuda catch of the day was fantastic. Some tart salty crumbly topping. The sauce was like a pumpkin symphony with an impossibly savory flavor. The pumpkin puree had a pleasant muted flavor that balanced out the fish perfectly.

The bill came with a chocolate popsicle with marzipan inside. So cute!

Throughout the meal, service was also
impeccable - above and beyond what I would expect from even a fine dining restaurant. For example, when I left half of the bruschetta on my plate and told them I got too full, the waitress said she would wait 15 min until putting in the next dish so I would have time to digest. After my meal, the hostess actually walked me out and we chatted about travels and the restaurant. She showed me a safe spot to wait for my grab. While I was waiting, someone brought me bug spray. Then the chef came out to greet me and we chatted for a few minutes! The staff was so kind and attentive. Importantly, I never felt out of place for dining alone.

Orange fish starter is very delicious and just right. The beef dish tastes fresh and delicious.
Maincourse I choose fish of the day and that day the grouper was cooked to the most delicious and smooth level.

Each dish had its own distinct flavor. The sauces were all unique; even the salad had a unique and delicious combination.

The other appetizers, the sides, the main course, and even the dessert were all excellent. It felt like I was dining at multiple restaurants at once.

My only slight regret was the steak. The first few pieces were tender and fragrant, but the last few were a bit greasy. I wonder if it was because I was too full earlier.

• Inspired by Italian Chef Patron Alessio Rasom, Si Dining presents as an open air, laid back terrace style setting with an intriguing lighting-scape. The natural darkness of the terrace is buttressed with stylish table lighting, bold illumination from a kitchen centrepiece with a gorgeous, grammable green wall feature that feels like an unintentional ode to Prince Vulcan.
• Alessio offers an Italian Viet fusion style of cuisine yet we couldn’t help but fall back to his twists on the Italian classics and his pimped up cold cut platter, white asparagus, carbonara and panacotta were equally moreish & delicious.
• Sommelier Trinh’s esetoric wine suggestions were intriguing, yet I doubled down on the Antiniori Chianti Classico for that 2nd glass.

It was flat out an amazing experience all around, even compared to our dining experiences in Hong Kong. It was our last dinner in Da Nang before our departure.

Our main server was Ngoc [aka Piccola] and she was just extremely welcoming from our first step into the restaurant. She was attentative snd friendly throughout our entire evening. She explained each dish with a smile. She was awesome!

The staff welcomed us to sit on the 2nd floor where there were only two other tables and the music was a bit more tame. It was a pleasant scenery where on one side we saw some beautiful interior artwork and on the flipside was a beautiful backdrop of the city with trees and ferris wheel.

Now onto the food.. flat out amazing. We said wow at least 50 times throughout our meal. All the dishes were fantastic but the standouts where the duck and the lambchops. They blew us away with the quality of food cooked to perfection with mindblowing flavors. These two dishes, in our opinion, were equivalent to Michelin star dishes. If we had another day. We would have easily gone back again to try everything else. The plate was so clean when we finished, we cracked up laughing.

We felt the meal was really well priced for the quality of food that we had. Would give 6 stars if we can.

Food by owner and chef was superb! Portions were great and can you imagine, they change their menu daily based on fresh produce of the day procured

I love that they can section off the 2nd storey that has unblocked views for private events . Where mind was held and ground floor for main dining  which is also where I enjoyed my 1st dine in experience.

This restaurant team can deliver a full fledged event from Hair , make up, sound and system alongside with blooms arrangements and photography services too.

The overall dining experience was excellent. Let me begin with the food and my appreciation of the Chef.

The Chef prepares food in a way that leaves you understanding it’s beauty to the sight and it’s delectable to the taste. The presentation of dishes is complimented by beautiful dishes and cutlery. Each entree led my appetite to anticipate and be ready for the next enjoyable morsel. Big hats to the Chef as I could really understand his love and joy of cooking in each bite. The experience did not stop there.

The wait staff was excellent and accommodating. They clearly understood each dish, the ingredients and preparation. When asked anything they did not know they sought answers and responded with high knowledge. They were highly skilled and very supportive of my dietary needs. They even picked up on special needs of my family.

I had diner with my family of four. My two children who can be quite picky said, “except for Momma’s Si’s is the best food they have ever eaten!” To satisfy two school age children is another feat well delivered by Si.

To top everything off the overall ambience and music together with a backdrop of banana trees gave us, even with other diners around the feeling of being in a quiet private resort.

The appetizer courses have a nice acidity that subtly highlights the flavors of the seafood.

The mint provides a nice bright contrast to the barracuda.

The char on the onion pairs nicely on the squid.

The olives provide the right amount of salinity to the beef cheek lasagna.

The pigeon is beautifully cooked... Although I did feel it could have used just a touch more salt.

The guava dessert is refreshing and light.

Again, there's a lot of subtlety going on demonstrating chef's fine craftsmanship.

I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn’t the Italian restaurant I had pictured, it was better! The decor and restaurant layout was very inviting and calming, staff were very attentive and friendly and of course the food did not disappoint!
Each dish we ordered had elements that took skill and creativity, not just ‘pizza and pasta’.
The ‘sandwich’ style pizza had us confused when it didn’t look like pizza but it was amazing and clever!
I would rate it higher than most Italian restaurants from where I am from.

Originating from the prestigious Michelin-starred restaurants of France, the chef and his wife took a transformative bicycle expedition from France all the way to Vietnam. This wasn’t just a physical journey but an exploration of diverse cultures, flavors, and the raw essence of life itself. The couple’s decision to lay down roots in the tranquil surroundings of Da Nang is testimony to their passion for authenticity. Drawing from this wealth of experience and a dedication to the finest ingredients, from premium Greek olive oil to the fiery red pepper of Phu Quoc Island, the culinary masterpieces at Si Dining are more than just meals - they are experiences.

The restaurant's stunning design and meticulous attention to detail create a captivating ambiance. The attentive service adds to the overall luxury, making you feel truly pampered.

The wine selection, is top-notch and complements the exquisite cuisine perfectly. The melt-in-your-mouth fish sashimi is a delightful starter, and the carne salada carpaccio is a flavorful treat. The barracuda fish of the day, perfectly cooked, showcases the chef's expertise.

The pork cannelloni is a standout dish, prepared to perfection. For dessert, the guava dessert was out of this world and the homemade Nutella options are highly recommended, offering a sweet and satisfying conclusion to your meal.

Remarkably, this exceptional dining experience, complete with a glass of blue label whiskey and amaretto, all this  priced at just $95. It's an incredible value for the level of quality and luxury you receive. This restaurant is an absolute must-visit for anyone seeking a memorable Italian fine dining experience.

The amuse-bouche was butter and salami spread on bread, which whetted our appetite.
I remember that fried balls with cheese were also served, which were quite delicious.
Next, the squid flavor spread in my mouth, and it felt greasy and rough, but the taste was amazing, and the greasy feeling disappeared right away when I drank sparkling water and wine.
The pasta seemed to be made of talaitelle instead of regular noodles, and the flavor was amazing.
The main dish, pigeon, had a slight pigeon flavor, but it was flavorful and juicy.
The steak was lightly seasoned, but it was great to eat with wine.
As expected of a fine dining restaurant, they brought water every time we ran out and took good care of the wine.
The plates were cleared right away, and the chef even came to greet us to ask if it was okay.

We had a veg salad, a scallop risotto, and, wait for this… a Kontum ‘stinky’ crab spaghetti, pairing with a rose wine bottle and a lively, slightly sparkling beautiful red bottle. The salad was truly exceptional. When was the last time someone, any one could make a salad exceptional? I couldn’t recall. The scallop risotto was absolutely stunning, I don’t have words to do it justified. “It must be a regular Best-Seller on the menu, right”? Wrong, the Chef explained that he had it on the menu here for the first time. He changes the menu daily. That’s just crazy! If you happen to see it on the menu again, jump right on it! The Kontum crab spaghetti was what “sealed the deal” for me. It wasn’t the most delicious dish_ that title went to the risotto. ‘Stinky’ crab was a little known delicacy of minority highlanders in nearby Kontum, very obscured because of ethno-geographic reasons and its well …, ‘stinky’ smell. Even I only heard of it but never have tried before. To combine that to an asian dish was tough enough, let alone a western one but it came out really cool. You still need to work on the smell a little bit though to enjoy it. So like durian or certain cheeses, I doubt it will be a regular item for everyone. But I had so much fun tasting it and will recommend it to any adventurous
foodies out there. And that added a really nice touch to what I really love here overall. Not only he’s so talented and serious in his work, but he’s also very daring, very fun in his creativity, and everything came out in high standard. You’ll see it everywhere from the first greetings when you step into this place. Next time if you’re in Da Nang,  give yourself a treat here.

We ordered a course meal, including appetizers and dessert, for 1,550 won per person, plus a wine pairing for 720 won. At around 120,000 won per person, it's a bit steep, but after trying it myself, I think you'd have to pay 2-2.5 times that amount in Korea to justify it. I can't forget the delicious food in this wonderful restaurant, and my mom said it was like a dream come true! They paired the food with wine, and even though I'm not a wine expert, it was delicious. The chef came and explained the dishes to me, and I could feel his sincerity. Both my mom and I loved it. Make wonderful memories at SiDining in Da Nang on your special day! Even if you're not in a course meal, they also have a variety of a la carte options, with many dishes priced from 10,000 to 30,000 won, so feel free to stop by!

The staffs are all so approachable and always making sure that you are enjoying your moments dining at their restaurants.

The menu changes regularly so I don’t see a point of elaborating much of the menu. However, the food are well thought out and served in a very elegant way and unpretentious.

For those having restricted dietary, need not to worry. You can always ask the restaurant in advanced to get your menu customised to your needs and concerns.

And also I would like to thank the team for a surprised birthday desserts. A simple but yet a powerful red velvet cake and the staff sing the birthday song for me unknowingly.

I am so grateful for the effort that the team has done to us. Hopefully I can visit them again some time on our next visit.

It was so hot even at 8pm that I couldn't enjoy the course meal at all. And there is no boundary between the inside and outside, so the smell of cigarettes smoked outside comes right in. There may be differences in taste, but I only tasted two dishes (I asked them to leave out cilantro, but they forgot and when I asked again, they took out the fish dish first. If you don't like cilantro, be sure to check this out) If you are looking for a fine dining experience with just an atmosphere, I recommend it!!

The staff were very friendly and they did their best to give good service. We were 4 people and the food was good overall. The staff did a fantastic job and they offered some extra treet since we were celebrating a birthday.

My dish was pasta ( paccheri ) amatriciana. I think the chef might be Italian but honestly I was a bit disappointed with the amatriciana since it was very sweet and it was basically pasta with some pancetta ( not guanciale ) and mixed with onions and some tomato.

Amatriciana is supposed to be a tomato sauce. ( Not an onion mixture with some pieces of tomato ) Onions are not common in this dish in Italy but it do exist, however it's never sweet like mine was. The sauteed onions can be nice but it took over and the sweetness was too sharp. You can see the picture of my dish and compare to any other picture of a plate of amatriciana online and you can understand what I mean.

Every other dish we had was very good and the kitchen did a wonderful job. It might be advisable to write on the menu that the shrimp pasta has shrimp tartar ( raw shrimp ). Beef carpaccio very good as well as the octopus.

I know restaurants want to earn money ( I've worked in a kitchen since 16 years back ) but when I asked for ""normal water"" or still water from a machine they said they serve water from bottles ( which obviously are more expensive ). We finished 3 bottles which were 60K each. At the end of our dinner however they served us free water without us asking for it from a jug so not sure why I couldn't get this free water from the start ?

Just small things I personally think can improve or be more clear but overall a wonderful experience and it's a very good choice to come here for a dinner.",5,5,5,Dine in,Dinner,,10/3/2023,10/3/2025

Recommended for dinner on the last day of your Danang trip!
It's quieter than other crowded and hectic restaurants, and the food is clean and delicious!

The ambiance is very welcoming, upon arrival there is a guy open the car door and usher us reception.

Excellent food. Menu is extensive and seasonal to a particularly high standard. I browse through online menu prior visiting to decide on lobster, however the menu on that day did not have it.
After checking with waitress, the chef didn't find any good lobster on that day and removed from menu.
That is some quality assurance from high standard chef right that.

Have to mention the food presentation is beautiful and the taste is amazing. Pork dish is succulent and probably the best I had so far.

I was so grateful for the excellent service from each and every staff member. I was so touched by the meticulous attention to detail from everyone in the restaurant. It's located about 60,000 dong from the city center. When I got off the Grab, the security guard opened the car door and welcomed me. Today, I really wanted wine, not food, so the staff member recommended a white wine that Koreans would enjoy. Wow, it was so delicious, I was so touched. I really didn't have an appetite, so they gave me a cheese platter and three slices of bread to dip in honey. The chef came out midway through and said hello. It was just like a scene from a movie! I also ordered tuna sashimi, and it was generous. And maybe persimmon?! I don't know for sure, but something sweet went well with the tuna sashimi. Wow, it was amazing! I felt like I was eating food.

The interior is tasteful and classy. Service is good and friendly. Best of all however is the food. We were first time visitors and had beef carpaccio and squid as starters. Both dishes were excellent. My main course was beef ravioli which was simply fantastic. My desert (lemon on lemon) was creative (lemon tartlett, warm lemon cream and sorbet) and very good. If there is anything to improve than I would recommend a more intense taste in the sorbet which was a bit neutral. But this is minor compared to the overall performance. The espresso was a perfect finale . As my wife didn't feel hungry I cannot describe more dishes but we will find out with our next visits.",,,,,Dinner,,10/3/2022,10/3/2025

The first time I visited the restaurant, I was quite impressed by the neat, cozy and clean space, feeling very close like eating at home. The restaurant is not too fussy in the way it is decorated but brings comfort and ease to diners. 

Regarding the food, it must be said that it is delicious and suitable for the taste. The dishes are seasoned well, rich, keeping the traditional flavor. In particular, the rustic dishes are carefully prepared, the ingredients are fresh and eye-catching. I ordered a few dishes to try, and all of them were ""satisfactory"". Compared to the general level, the prices here are very reasonable, worthy of the quality received. 

Another big plus is the service: the staff are friendly, agile, always welcoming to customers. Thanks to that, the dining experience becomes much more pleasant. 

In short, Kim Kitchen is a restaurant worth saving on the list when coming to Da Nang. Delicious, reasonably priced, and with a comfortable atmosphere – the perfect “eat well, have fun, and remember forever” standard.

I had pork skewers to wrap in rice paper and my boyfriend had the steak and egg. My pork was extremely dry and on a chopstick so no lemongrass flavour. The pork itself seemed to have zero herbs or seasoning. The rest of the plate was a decent selection of fillings for the roll. My boyfriend's steak was rare and not even a steak as pictured but basically stir fry beef. His fried eggs were overcooked and dry.

To be fair to the girl serving us - Nany - she recognised that I was not happy with the food and asked me if I was ok. I explained that the meat was dry and she took it back to the kitchen.

BẾP KIM – Kim Restaurant and Coffee is hands down one of the best dining experiences I’ve had in Vietnam! From the moment we stepped in, we were welcomed with warm hospitality, a beautiful atmosphere, and the aroma of freshly prepared, authentic Vietnamese food.

The dishes are bursting with flavor – every bite is a perfect balance of traditional recipes and modern finesse. Whether you’re trying the grilled meats, fresh spring rolls, or their signature coffee drinks, everything is crafted with love and high-quality ingredients. Even the smallest details are thoughtfully curated – from the presentation of the dishes to the cleanliness and comfort of the space.

The owners and staff go above and beyond to make you feel at home. They speak multiple languages, and their passion for great food and customer care shines through in everything they do.

If you’re in Da Nang and want a taste of true Vietnamese cuisine in a relaxed, stylish setting – BẾP KIM is an absolute must-visit. We’ll definitely be coming back. Highly recommended!

I let them know and a few minutes later they served with the one i believe it's just the first one with ice removed...with the same glass and it's not hot at all. How much trouble will it be to just make another real HOT Americano? Also there's no avocado in the veggie salad, then don't put it in the picture as it's very misleading. The portion of the beef dish also very small and the beef is VERY chewy....The environment is nice but everything else just so wrong.

We also requested other dishes, only to discover many of them were out of stock.

The atmosphere felt quite stuffy, and there were flies buzzing around, which was off-putting. The food was average at best, and to make matters worse, they forgot one of our orders, causing us to cancel it.

Additionally, be aware that there’s a 3% charge for using a credit card. I expected a restaurant of this caliber to be more credit card friendly. Overall, my experience was underwhelming, and I don't think I’ll be returning.",2,2,2,Dine in,Brunch,,1/3/2025,10/3/2025

I'd been obsessed with banh xeo for a month, eating it in so many places, and it was all delicious.
But the banh xeo here, as soon as I took a bite, filled my mouth with an unbelievable, porky smell. It wasn't just a smell, it was a rotten smell.

I asked the man who seemed to be the manager if this was normal, but he said it was the traditional flavor and that it was normal.
I couldn't believe that this was the traditional flavor I hadn't tasted anywhere in a month.

Banh xeo is usually only available for lunch, but since I visited late in the morning, I asked if it was available. The manager confirmed with the kitchen and said it was available, so I ordered it.

I wondered if that was the problem. Maybe they substituted the meat that wasn't ready yet with whatever was left?

I ended up throwing the banh xeo away after just one bite.
Even after leaving the restaurant and finishing a mango smoothie at another cafe, the unpleasant, porky, rotten smell persisted. Even after another cup of coffee...
Phew... I finally went back to the hotel and brushed my teeth twice.

Judging by the lack of similar comments in other Korean reviews, there must have been something wrong with the banh xeo I had. The manager didn't even bother checking the food, just assumed it didn't suit a traveler's palate. It was disappointing.

They sell different breakfast and lunch menus.
I had breakfast and it was so delicious that I ate lunch the next day.
If you choose the recommended food and eat it, it's definitely delicious.
I thought there would be a spicy smell because there were only locals, but it wasn't and it was delicious👍👍
For drinks, I tried coconut coffee, mango smoothie, and Americano, and they were all delicious.
They cut and grind the fruit right there.
You don't have to go to Kong Cafe. It's even more delicious.

This restaurant offers fantastic fine dining. We paid about 1.5 mil per person for an extensive French cuisine dinner that would cost at least 3 to 4 mil in France or Belgium.

We have been going to this restaurant for many years and it seems the owners continue to invest in high-quality ingredients in order to provide an exceptional and creative dining experience - for what we know we can get from living in Da Nang.

I hope this wonderful couple will also invest in a better understanding of an international dining etiquette and what a perfect customer service should be for this level of hospitality.

Please reach out to me and my company if you'd like to get more customers and grow your revenues by investing in staff training and high level hospitality customer service.

When I finally got to the restaurant, all the staff were incredibly attentive, especially the designated server was incredibly sweet and friendly
My husband and I both had a course meal with wine pairing and I say it was the best decision!

I feel like I shall come back to Danang just for this restaurant once again
One of the staff even guided us to the main road after offering us unbrellas for the rain (how sweet)
Thanks all for your work and the food is incredible of course

+I think it is not well known to Koreans, so I will write in Korean to recommend it.
Fine dining & wine pairing was about 100,000 won per person, and I had a really fantastic experience.
Whenever I travel, I seek diverse experiences that are hard to find in Korea, and this is a really recommended place among fine dining in Vietnam.
It is composed of 3 floors, so it is good to go with family. I recommend it 10/10",5,5,5,Dine in,Dinner,Korean,1/3/2025,10/3/2025

From start to finish, the experience was nothing short of magical.

The journey to the venue was an adventure in itself. We were dropped off at a dimly lit alley, where we navigated puddles and uneven ground, all adding to the excitement and mystery. Climbing an unbelievably steep flight of stairs to the venue further heightened the anticipation. At the top, we were warmly welcomed by Tracy’s radiant smile and stepped into a beautifully lit dining room that felt like it was reserved just for us. The ambiance was intimate yet relaxed, with candles, crisp napkins, and elegantly set tables that promised a special evening without feeling overly formal.

The multi-course menu was a testament to Chef Nguyen’s artistry and creativity. Each dish was thoughtfully crafted with fresh, local ingredients and presented with flair. While Chef Nguyen didn’t personally introduce the dishes, it was clear that his expertise and vision were infused into every element of the meal. The team’s professionalism and warmth in explaining each course made us feel equally valued and connected to the culinary journey.

What we loved most was the air of mystery that surrounded the evening. The secret location and unknown menu made every moment a delightful surprise. Chef Nguyen and his wife’s passion and attention to detail transformed what could have been just another dinner into a memorable journey of flavors, culture, and warm hospitality.

When Tracy asked for feedback at the end of the evening, my only comment was that I wished it could have lasted longer. Perhaps it felt too short simply because we were having such a wonderful time enjoying the food, wine, and engaging conversation.

What made this evening even more remarkable was how it compared to two other notable meals we had during our trip—visits to Michelin-starred restaurants in the city. On the way back to our hotel and even during our flight home, we unanimously agreed that SecretEATS at City High Dining edged out the Michelin-starred experiences. Both the food and the atmosphere at City High Dining were simply superior—a true testament to the passion and dedication of Chef Nguyen and Tracy.

City High Dining truly brought the SecretEATS concept to life in one of the best ways we’ve ever experienced. I’m already planning my next visit to see how Nguyen and Tracy continue to push boundaries and make the experience even better. To Chef Nguyen, Tracy, and the entire team at City High Dining—bravo and well done!",5,5,5,,,,1/3/2025,10/3/2025

City High offers a truly unique and unforgettable dining experience. The moment you step inside, you're greeted by a super elegant atmosphere that sets the stage for a memorable meal.

From the delightful local-inspired appetizers to the exquisite scallops and perfectly cooked lamb racks, each dish is a masterpiece. The refreshing basil sorbet cleanses the palate, and the dessert of Bailey's and Milo macaroons with tamarind paste and English tea is a delightful finale.

It's a truly exceptional experience that you won't find easily elsewhere. The fact that this level of culinary sophistication is available in a small valley within Da Nang City is even more impressive.

*below is my old review back to 2022:
Impressed with the food quality and customer service. They all are very attentive and caring. You might find the location a bit weird as it is in a small alley. Yet the moment you get inside, you just feel like you get to France somehow. Probably that is the sense of piece in mind. Highly appreciated that.",5,5,5,Dine in,Dinner,,10/3/2024,10/3/2025

It wasn’t easy to find this amazing restaurant as it’s tucked away in a little alley but once we entered, we were greeted and seated straight away.
The dishes went from great to better. Foie gras is an absolute show stopper, closely followed by truffle risotto and squid ink pasta. Plan ahead and make sure you have enough space in the belly for the salted crème brûlée.
Fresh cocktails compliments the food together with the amazing hospitality from the family run business.

The meal, advertised as a unique and special experience, fell far short of our expectations.

The evening began at 8 p.m. with a reservation in a nearly empty restaurant. We were uncertain about what to expect regarding the food and service, both of which turned out to be disappointingly subpar.

Our server team, despite their friendly demeanor, struggled with their English, which hindered communication as our dissatisfaction grew. The meal seemed more suited for social media appeal than actual dining enjoyment.

Our dinner commenced with an attractive yet tasteless garlic bread-like roll. Its presentation was photogenic, but it was dry and unappetizing on the inside.

A lengthy wait preceded the second course, accompanied by a mediocre sparkling wine. The servers' sweet efforts to describe the wine in broken English only delayed us from eating our rapidly cooling food. The meal's pacing was consistently off.

Throughout dinner, used utensils and glassware cluttered our table until we specifically asked for them to be cleared. This lack of attention was surprising for a restaurant claiming to offer a fine dining experience.

The second course featured artistically presented, but bland and poorly textured tiny shrimps.

Each course's utensils were brought after the dish was served, reflecting a lack of professionalism.

The third course, an egg-yolk ravioli, was the only decent item, though it was served cold.

A baffling moment occurred when a server showcased an attractive bun, purportedly Beef Wellington, only to inform us it needed another 15 minutes of cooking. It was odd to be presented with an unready dish.

Even worse, my vegetarian wife received a fish dish so unpalatable that she barely tasted it.

The wine pairings ranged from unremarkable to downright awful. When the Beef Wellington finally arrived, it was tough and stringy, a far cry from the Wagyu beef they claimed it to be. Inadequately equipped with only a standard dinner knife, I struggled to cut through the meat, causing its components to fall apart.

Dessert didn't improve matters, consisting of a mediocre assortment including a tart, a mushy macaron, a cookie, and a sugary gummy shaped like a marijuana leaf, reminiscent of children's candy. Most dishes seemed designed more for photography than for eating.

Despite claims of high-quality ingredients, the dishes, such as the mealy ""caviar,"" suggested otherwise. We left the restaurant early, deeply disappointed.

On our ride home, we read reviews warning of the owner threatening locals for negative feedback. We're not from Vietnam, but we feel compelled to caution potential diners: this establishment delivers poor food, unprofessional service, and overall disappointment at a steep price.

If the owner resorts to intimidation over honest reviews, this should be reported to the authorities. We were promised a unique dining experience, and it certainly was unique - just not in the way it was intended.

Do not dine here!!

*********
Editing my review to respond to the baffling and false assertions by the “management” of this weird and terrible restaurant:

How disturbing that you refer to watching us (or this other person and his wife Helen) on CCTV.  I imagine this is just another falsehood.

It's clear that you spend more time trying to rescue your reputation than establish it.

*** Updated one more time to add that after two weeks, we did receive a full refund.  The rest of my review stands as a true reflection of our experience.",1,1,1,Dine in,Dinner,,10/3/2024,10/3/2025

The service was top-notch; the staff were helpful, explained each dish thoroughly, and were extremely professional

We were amazed by the atmosphere, the friendliness of the staff, the quality and presentation of dishes were divine. The place is very cozy and intimate. Beautiful architecture with open kitchen. Especially impressed with the chef, he works with all passion. You can feell all of their passion in each menu they prepared, the way they care for small things.

Food was absolutely fantastic and we were totally blown away. You could see so much thought had gone into every dish. Fresh and fragrant ingredients, full of flavour and refinement. We tried the foie gras, the flavor is married together and really stunning. Then the seasonal fish delivered mouthwatering satisfaction with tenderness and soft texture. The desserts were perfect enough with 3 main ingredients : basil, wild honey, lemon zest brought the perfect combination. Great wine list with fair pricing.

Food of course depends on taste, I personally like wonton (can't remember the name) because of the interesting texture and flavor of that dish, and mushroom rice (can't remember the specific name either 😭) with risotto sauce is a bit normal, nothing special, lacks highlights for me personally. The number of dishes is a bit small to choose from. Oh, the portion is quite a lot, I ate 2 plates by myself and was so full I was breathless 😂 this meal cost about more than 500k, the price is quite okay",5,4,5,Dine in,Dinner,Vietnamese,10/3/2023,10/3/2025

I had a 4-course set menu, but the food was a bit spicy, so I never thought I could really eat it in Vietnam, whether in terms of taste or atmosphere. The appetizers were challenging and experimental, and the main menu was slightly spicy but really delicious. It was really nice that the dessert cherry dish was finished neatly at the end.
The manager explained everything from seating instructions to food explanations in English since he was a foreigner, but he was very fluent and kind. I could tell the class of this restaurant by the way they were careful and quiet when arranging the cutlery for each course.
I can't believe I can get this kind of food at this price.. It's really cool.

And it was difficult to find the entrance... Go to the end of the alley where there is a round ""CITY HIGH"" sign and turn right. Google Maps doesn't show today's alley, but people can pass by. There is a building with yellow lights at the end. You can go there!

Cons:
- The menu was confusing / some parts were in Vietnamese and it wasn’t very clear what the meals are
- I ordered a drink and asked to be without sugar. When it came it was super sweet. I asked, and the waitress said it was with syrup. I asked if I can get one without it, and she said I can’t since it’s already pre made with the syrup.

The soup was just a soup but very enjoyable nonetheless, ingredients full of life, neither stale nor old. The best part was the drinks. They were so good I ended up ordering three.

The moment I stepped in, I was greeted by a calming, Zen-like atmosphere that perfectly complements their philosophy of mindful eating. The food here is not only delicious but also artfully prepared, showcasing the beauty and versatility of vegetarian cuisine.

The menu offers a wide variety of dishes, from hearty soups to flavorful stir-fries, all made with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Every dish I’ve tried has been bursting with flavor, yet feels light and nourishing. One of my personal favorites is their signature pho, which has a rich, savory broth without any of the heaviness of traditional versions.

What I appreciate most about Sangha is their commitment to health-conscious eating. You can really tell that each meal is crafted with care and intention, making it a place where you can indulge without any guilt. The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and always willing to offer recommendations based on your preferences.

If I could give zero stars, I would. Sangha Vegetarian Restaurant markets itself as a high-end establishment, but the experience was nothing short of infuriating.

Here’s why:

1. Deceptive and Inaccurate Menu
They claim to have six rotating menus, but none of them are accurate. I asked about multiple items, and every time I was told they didn’t have what I wanted. When I inquired about protein options, I was first told there was none, then miraculously, a dish with tofu appeared. But guess what? The menu clearly stated it didn’t have tofu. Their excuse? “Translation mistake.” No, it’s not. It’s just a poorly managed menu.
Then, I saw another dish labeled as having spring rolls. They showed me a picture, and there were no spring rolls. Again, “translation mistake.” This is beyond ridiculous—how can customers make informed decisions when the menu is flat-out wrong?

2. Rude and Incompetent Staff
The staff were dismissive and treated me like an idiot for questioning the obvious contradictions in their menu. They walked off mid-conversation, leaving me to figure out the mess on my own. This level of service is unacceptable anywhere.

3. Ridiculously Overpriced
They charge many times more than other restaurants in Da Nang while offering subpar service and a chaotic dining experience. They’re pretending to be a premium establishment but fail to deliver on even the basics.

4. No Accountability
It’s clear the management doesn’t care. If they did, they’d have a proper menu, train their staff to be respectful, and ensure the customer experience matches the premium prices they charge.

Sangha is the worst restaurant I’ve ever been to. The owner should shut it down, fire everyone, and start fresh with a restaurant that has a functioning menu and a competent team. Save your money and eat literally anywhere else in Da Nang. This place is a total joke.",1,1,1,,,,1/3/2025,10/3/2025

The space is very large, beautiful and clean. It is obvious that they value design: the interior is made in a wooden style, many interesting details - bottles, inscriptions. The atmosphere is simply wow, everything looks civilized, stylish and pleasant. Even when we came, monarchs were sitting there, which added to the feeling of coziness and significance of the place.

Now about the prices. They are, in our opinion, above average. Even as a foreigner, I know many places where you can eat no less deliciously, but for less money. For Vietnam, this is a really expensive option.

As for the dishes: the presentation is beautiful, the food is delicious, but I can’t say that it is something incredible, for which I would like to come back again. Many dishes turned out to be very spicy, and we were not warned about this. For me, a lover of Indian and Asian spicy cuisine, this is still normal, but for my husband, who does not eat spicy food at all, this was a big problem.

Overall, the impressions are good, but for us, this place is not the kind of place we want to come back to. If you decide to come, know that it is delicious, beautiful, but be prepared for spicy dishes and a high bill.",5,5,5,Dine in,Dinner,Russian,2/3/2025,10/3/2025

- There is no phone number on Google, I arrived late and wanted to call to inform but had to contact via Facebook which was very inconvenient.

- The staff handled the situation unprofessionally, only said to hold the table for 10 minutes while when booking the table they did not tell me about this issue.

I would have rated 3 stars but thank you to the manager for handling the above situation very well.

🥢 Sangha - Vegetarian Restaurant: 84 Hoang Van Thu, Hai Chau, Da Nang
I leave behind the photos I took for fun, without editing or filters, so that you can truly see some of Sanghai's naturally attractive features. Each vegetarian dish has a harmonious flavor, quite a strange combination, and the decor is very delicate. For drinks, I recommend combining healthy juices! The space is cool, there is a garden, a lake, lots of green trees, the house has air conditioning, every corner is beautiful. Even each pair of chopsticks is wrapped in pandan leaves, both beautiful and fragrant, this is the first time I've seen it ^^
The price is not as cheap as normal vegetarian restaurants, because this is a restaurant with careful investment and attentive service. You will pay well for the quality of food, space and spirit here. The restaurant has Set Menus available for 4 people, priced around 400k - 600k. Today I went to eat for 2 people, ordered a few dishes and drinks for 200k/person.

Ordered noodle soup hotpot with é leaves. Vermicelli noodles are not boiled in boiling water and have a slightly sour smell. My 3-year-old child ate vermicelli and had a bloated stomach. He ate it from noon but still couldn't digest it at night. His stomach hurt and he vomited all the vermicelli!!! Let's ask, why is vermicelli made from pureed rice flour? Why do you eat it for more than half a day and still not be able to digest it? Or what substance is the vermicelli impregnated with???

This is my favorite vegetarian restaurant, because the vibes of the restaurant are very pleasant. Although located in the center, when entering the restaurant, I feel comfortable and extremely quiet. The restaurant is beautiful, every corner feels chill, airy and spacious. Outdoor tables and indoor tables have their own space 💯

The food is very delicious, suitable for the taste, beautifully presented, the price is a bit high compared to other vegetarian restaurants. When you come here, you must try the Garlic Butter Mushrooms, super delicious, every time I come here I have to order, sitting and writing but still craving 🤤 The bread pate is also okay, just the right amount of sourness. The fried wontons with sweet and sour sauce must be, I like crispy rolls so it suits me. The tofu with passion fruit sauce is a bit sour and the dill noodles are eaten like La Vong fish cakes, this is normal. You must try the orange palm tea, it's delicious and refreshing, I crave it 😂 Coconut lime is cool, cooling Shangha is too sour, not suitable huhu

Overall, I really like Sangha, I keep coming back 🙆🏼‍♀️

Vegetarian rice in the rainy afternoon, very delicious😋 ""The heart of the chef will create the unique flavor of the dish""
Chefs are considered the soul of the dish. Even if they cook the same recipe, the same ingredients, depending on each person's perception, they will create a unique flavor of the dish.
And with the common aloe vera plant, through the hands of the home chef, it has become a dish that attracts visitors when they come here
The cold rain at the end of the year has gradually become gentler, more mellow... just enough to be cool interspersed with the fragile sunlight.
That atmosphere seems to implicitly signal that Tet is approaching, another year is about to pass with many gains and losses, cherishing, and regrets.

At first, we were afraid of getting bored, but the food was quite diverse, presented in European style and leaning towards organic, clean food. According to the staff, the menu is also changed weekly. The drinks are also extremely high quality, our group had to ask for more ice to make it less bland. If you don't eat, coming here to sit and drink water is also quite okay.

The restaurant only has a pretty space and lots of trees. The food is not delicious compared to a restaurant standard.
The dishes are all cold, the bread is not crispy. The clay pot rice is not sticky, separate and seems like it is not freshly cooked. That is my personal feeling.
The drinks are also normal.

My friend and I arrived at the restaurant at 20:35. Because we did not carefully research the restaurant's closing time, we went to eat late. The staff still received customers as usual. While waiting for the food, I saw them cleaning the restaurant. Because I was shy, I asked what time the restaurant closed, and they said 21:00, so I told them that because we did not research the time, we were sorry if we were late. My friend and I tried to eat as quickly as possible so that they had time to clean up and leave early.
While we were eating, at 21:07 the staff turned off the lights and air conditioner, at 21:12 they brought the bill out and left on the table, saying we had to pay right away (a polite way of chasing us away), and it was not very pleasant.
From the beginning, if you have accepted customers, you have accepted that your closing time will be a little later than the time on your contract. If you do not want to accept customers anymore, you should notify us that you are about to close or something so that we can go eat somewhere else comfortably. :(",1,5,1,Dine in,Dinner,Vietnamese,4/3/2025,10/3/2025

Vinh Hanh Cantonese BBQ didn't just meet our expectations-it far exceeded them. From the moment we stepped in, the rich aroma of roasted meats and the lively atmosphere transported us straight to Hong Kong.

They had a hard time during Covid, where the quality fell a little, but now they are back full throttle at the highest level, they can compete with even a traditional BBQ place in Hong Kong.

The Peking Duck was flawless-crispy, golden skin with succulent meat with hoisin sauce. The Roasted Crispy Pork Belly was unbelievable-shattering crackling. melt-in-your-mouth fat, and tender, flavorful meat. Their signature sauces took every bite to another level, each carefully crafted to enhance the meats.

Service was fast, friendly, and passionate about the food. Every dish was prepared with authentic Cantonese precision, making this a must-visit spot for anyone craving real Hong Kong BBQ in Da Nang.",5,5,5,Dine in,Dinner,,4/3/2025,10/3/2025

As soon as you walk in you are greeted by the hanging crispy, succulent, glistening fresh BBQ duck and pork. You can see more meat roasting in the ovens, and the continuos takeaway orders being prepared.

This restaurant looks like it has only a few tables, but there is a second floor that provides even more dining including a great covered balcony.

We ordered the platter with 2 types of meat, concurring with others that while we found it ample to feed 2 people it seemed smaller than it appears on the menu.

The meats were tender and seasoned perfectly with authentic flavours. Morning glory was fresh with the undeniable sizzling garlic juices, and our fried rice held the authentic flavour, though we did find it odd that it contained zucchini but perhaps this is how it’s made in certain areas of HK but was new to us.

There were a lot of staff in the restaurant, but it seemed like they needed more servers on the ground floor as our waiter was run off his feet and did a great job at providing exceptional service despite the demand.

A warm welcome was the complimentary beverage for International Women’s Day, and the Peach Tea we ordered was super concentrated with actual slices of peach in it.

We look forward to returning to this wonderful restaurant in the city of Da Nang. Parking was easy, with a guard providing assistance out the front. Also great that they accept card payments.",5,5,5,,,,4/3/2025,10/3/2025

I ordered 2 duck rice dishes (no soup) and stir-fried pho, with stir-fried chili oil served with the dish, seasoned to taste, stir-fried pho with strong flavor is to my taste. Snakehead fish soup with sour cabbage was okay, I ordered a small bowl as shown in the picture, the cooking oil was floating. 
Customers came and went regularly, the staff did not pay attention to let customers get their own menus. The menu design was not good, although it was thick, beautiful and clear, but it felt difficult to flip back and forth. 
The kitchen was opposite the customer seating area, there were many staff, the dishes came out quickly. 
The tables sitting next to the door facing the street were slightly blocked by the door because it was higher than the neck when the customers sat, the chairs were low and the tables were high so it was uncomfortable to sit.

But I asked for a cup of soy sauce and had to ask 4 times and I didn't get it. I wanted to get up and go home. I was sitting with my family so I just let it be and asked for the 5th time (if my parents weren't there, I would have stood up to pay and left). Review this issue carefully.

Food was really good especially the meat combo which you'd get roasted pork, duck, chicken and char siu pork.  We came here twice because the food was so good. Get their soups, all of them are good. The tofu dish was just okay for me. All the roasted meats were so delicious. The hong Kong style french toast was out of this world and same with their hong Kong milk tea, so good. The wait staff here were so kind and sweet too and yet they had to deal with rude customers when we were there. Not going to name the country these customers were from but this is Vietnam, try to communicate in the local language with a smile.
Even though the waitresses were trying to communicate, yelling at them in your own language wasn't going to get you anything.  They were so rude to the wait staff and I was like what the heck dude, don't travel to other countries if you treat people like that. Then they yelled for the bill in their own language again and then got into their own private luxury van. Clearly money doesn't teach manners.",5,5,5,Dine in,Lunch,,10/3/2024,10/3/2025

We ordered an appetizer and 3 entrees. One of those entrees was the sweet and sour pork. First bite I took was so tough I had to spit it out. I took a second bite to see if it was any different… it was not. The dish was tough and dry, seemed like it had been reheated from a prior day. We returned the plate and asked them not to remake it. The other dishes were OK but we managed to eat what we could. We asked not to pay for the sweet and sour pork but were told we “ate it all” and could not be given to us for free.  We are not picky eaters but that dish was inedible… The gentleman who went back and forth with us was not pleasant to work with.

Most of the customers ordered delivery more than ate at the restaurant, while I only sat in and out, there were only 2-3 tables. 

I chose the BBQ combo of 2 dishes: duck and roast pork, both were delicious. At first, the plate looked very small, it felt like a small amount, but after eating, it was enough for 2 people. Order another bowl of white rice and it was done 🤤 The sauce was a bit sweet, the meat juice in the plate was more delicious. The char siu noodles were like homemade noodles, not like packaged noodles, chewy and delicious. The char siu was a bit salty, the thin meat was a bit dry. The broth was light and fatty, I like the sauce mixed with dry noodles better. The Hong Kong milk tea was normal, not as delicious as the shops I tried before, but it was also served in a shaker, which was also strange. The ginseng juice was sweet.

Before the list of dishes on Now (Shopee), every time the restaurant called to add 10k/dish, not a problem, but why didn't they raise the price on Now, which is always the same?
Recently, on the Baemin list, there are only a few dishes available. When I order, I ask the restaurant to change to another dish, but the restaurant doesn't notify me and still delivers the wrong dish to the shipper?
If you order at the restaurant 15 minutes in advance and tell them it's ready to be picked up for convenience, the food arrives uncooked, while the restaurant is empty and you have to wait for the kitchen to prepare it for a long time.

Even though I like the restaurant's food, with the owner's lack of professionalism, I will probably never eat here again.",,,,,,Vietnamese,10/3/2022,10/3/2025

✅Strengths: Clean space.
❌Disadvantages: Oily food, only suitable for those who are used to eating Chinese food.
---Details---
🏠 The restaurant is located on the front of Phan Chau Trinh Street, the front of the restaurant is wide, there is a sidewalk for motorbikes (there is a security guard), cars can park on the street.
🏠 The restaurant has the style of a Chinese restaurant, cozy space, using high tables and chairs, large table tops, with glass panels above. The restaurant only has indoor seating (with air conditioning). The restaurant's kitchen is located right next to the entrance, with a transparent partition so it can be seen from the outside. The restaurant's service staff is quite large (compared to the area of the restaurant).
🦆 I tried ordering the dishes [Tu Hy Lam Mon Roasted Duck], [Fried Wonton], [Cauliflower Soup]. In general, I rarely eat Chinese food because it's oily and doesn't suit the taste, so I'll skip the food review 😁. 
💰 The menu prices are quite diverse, on average, to eat enough, each person can spend about 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣k-1️⃣5️⃣0️⃣k, the price is quite high compared to the general level. However, you can try it to experience because the number of Chinese restaurants in Da Nang is not much. 
🌟 The restaurant is suitable for families (with high chairs for babies) or groups, the optimal number of people is 4-6.

The menu has many dishes but not messy. All the dishes I ate here are extremely delicious, only two dishes may be a bit bland for my taste.
In particular, you should try Uyen Uong milk coffee tea. This is a typical Hong Kong drink. Here, not only does it taste better than all the restaurants I've had it in Vietnam, but it can also be compared to many restaurants I've had it in Hong Kong.
Regarding the food, I have nothing to complain about. I tried the stir-fried pho (similar to Hanoi's pan-fried pho but with a different sauce), the roasted dishes including roasted duck, roasted chicken, roasted pork, and char siu. All are very delicious. You should also try Thai Tu fried rice, fried bread with butter and peanuts in the middle, salt and pepper tofu, etc.

The staff were sitting at the entrance, drinking and chatting. (So, I didn't realize it was this restaurant until I got out of the taxi.)

Service: The staff were clean and friendly. They provided service in simple English.

Interior: The interior was unique and stylish, worth a visit. I especially loved the paintings on the wall.

Food: I ordered raw beef, pasta, and tteokbokki, but honestly, I was disappointed because it lacked unique flavor.

Price: 1.5 million dong, about 300,000 dong per dish, which is on the high side.

It was a good experience, but the menu was too monotonous. (The raw beef was delicious. The tteokbokki—oh, really, just tteokbokki?. The pasta—it was delicious, but lacked unique flavor.)

I also visited a tavern in Hanoi early last year, and it had a similar feel, suggesting the same owner. I remember getting a similar feeling back then...

If I were to write this from the perspective of a self-employed person in Da Nang who wants to see more of their business,

I'd recommend heading towards a pub or wine bar. It looks like it's actually better to open it.
It seems difficult to find anything special on the menu to compete on food.
Even if the menu is reduced and the drinks and alcoholic beverages are strengthened, the interior, atmosphere, and music seem to have the potential to compete.",5,4,5,,Dinner,Korean,9/28/2025,10/3/2025

The round bulletproof glass windows set into the ceiling create a unique play of light in the room. And of course, you can constantly see what one fish or another is doing. The menu is varied and should have something for every taste. The price range is in the mid-to-upper price range. The dishes themselves are okay, but there's still room for improvement. The cocktail mixer is fun and also accommodates special requests.

The atmosphere is good, and there are a variety of seat types, including counter seats and private rooms, so it can be used for a variety of purposes.
The staff is friendly, so if you become a regular, you might be able to use it alone.

I also like that the background music is not EDM or up-tempo music unlike other Vietnamese restaurants.

Although it has a calm feel, it is not too chic and is perfect for people in their late 20s to 30s.

The food was also well prepared.

Above all, the aglio olio pasta and seafood tteokbokki were really delicious!!

It was quiet at 7pm but really picked up later. We started with cocktails (the signature cocktail and a gimlet) then had champagne & an excellent St Emillion Grand Cru. We had some snacks. The Korean potato pancake was great. Also the fried dumplings were
really delicious so was the sauce with it. We ordered the steak to share and it was perfectly cooked medium rare and was tender and delicious. We were amazed at the quality of food for a bar. The steak comes with caramelised onions that are delicious - we told the owner he should sell it in jars as a condiment.

I stayed at Livie (the hotel upstair) 3 nights and everynight this bar was my getaway. It has the charm of a hidden speakeasy, private, intimate but their attentive staffs, sexy music and lovely guests make it easy to open your heart to new encounters. Good selection of wine and spirits, but their cocktails are something one must try. I was lucky to be there at their first event with a guest bartender - Mr Tu Nguyen. He presented some of the most delightful original cocktails I have ever tasted, tailor made to the concept ""under the sea"". I haven't had such a good time like this in a while.

I don't understand the identity of this bar-restaurant, the drinks menu only consists of wine sold by the bottle. The choice of wine by the glass is only red or white, no grape variety (and no quantity on the menu either). So it's not what I call a bar.
For the restaurant part, the music is very loud, it's complicated to get a table and not eat at the bar even if our group (of 3) represented 50% of the customers.
As the music is very loud the waitress did not understand my order.",4,5,2,Dine in,Dinner,French,10/3/2023,10/3/2025

All these restaurants are changing unbelievable prices for a piece of lamb or chicken. Plate for this restaurant is almost $25 us dollars for a piece of lamb and rice. Compared to local food for $4 a good meal.  I ended up paying $10 for a bowel of soup with a small piece of bread.  Likewise Middle eastern and Turkish restaurants.  People that’s why noone is coming to your restaurants.  I don’t recommend,5,1,5,,,,2025-04-03,2025-10-03

Sardine ceviche

Tabbouleh

Fish tartare

Artichoke salad

Briwats

Hummus

Beef tajines

The restaurant has a typical Moroccan decor that takes you from Vietnam to Morocco upon entering!
A very warm and friendly atmosphere, which I really liked.

The food is very clean and very healthy,

The restaurant atmosphere is also very nice,

Well, this is one of the Halal places to eat in the Da Nang area if you are bored with Malay or Indian food. I have personally been to Danang several times, and when I go to Danang I usually go to local restaurants or any restaurant. So this time I accompanied my friend to eat at this restaurant. In terms of place, it's like a house that has been converted into a restaurant. The decoration is nice. 

In terms of food prices, for Vietnamese standards, it is actually expensive. In terms of portions (usually food in Vietnam, on average has large portions. Can feed 2 people with 1 side dish) but maybe because the owner is not Vietnamese and on average the eaters are foreigners so the portions are adjusted a bit small in my opinion. 

Moving on to the taste, the taste is definitely authentic because the cook is from the local area of the restaurant. But for me personally and my friends, the taste of the food did not suit our tongues. One of the foods that was in a pineapple, I thought it was rice and shrimp, but it turned out not to be.

4225,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSURUa3NxMEhREAE,41,win sam yeung,3 reviews · 4 photos,5.0,a year ago,"We traveled to Danang for only 4 days, visiting Bladi based on a friend's recommendation and the good reviews on Google. Despite our high expectations, Chef Samir, aka the owner, did not fail to meet the high standard. Having visited many Michelin-starred and Asia’s Top 50 restaurants, we can confidently say that the food at Bladi can compete with those, yet is much more affordable.

We had Chef Sam recommend dishes to us, and here we go the detailed comments on each dish:

Briwats (10/10!!!)
- It is stuffed with chicken and other savory fillings, a bite-sized appetizer perfectly fried to a golden crisp (not oily at all!). I'm not sure if this is the typical recipe, but the icing sugar on top is definitely a game-changer, making the savory dish super interesting.

Denjan Pastilla  (10/10!!!)
- Since I mentioned my love for eggplant, Chef Sam recommended this dish to us. I truly loved how he sliced the eggplant into thin layers, covering minced mushroom, lamb, raisins, feta cheese, and other flavorful ingredients. The combination elevated both taste and texture. As an eggplant lover, we finished the dish in 3 minutes!

Kefta Tagine (9/10)
- The lamb meatball is soft, juicy, and flavorful. Baked with mechoiua sauce, tomatoes, and runny eggs, this dish is a bread-killer! However, the most amazing part is their homemade Moroccan bread – freshly baked, hot, crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. The dough smells amazing and pairs perfectly with the Kefta. The reason I give it a 9/10 is that I wish there were four meatballs… I want more! :(

Crème Brûlée (8/10)
- This special version is peanut butter and dark chocolate flavored. Nothing overpowers the other, and it is not overly sweet either.

The place is cozy and clean, the food is fresh and tasty, and the host is warm and friendly. We had a truly satisfying dinner here and would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone seeking a good meal. =]

Again, much appreciation to Chef Sam for all your efforts in preparing this menu and excellent food. Hope to visit again very soon!",,,,Dine in,,,2024-10-03,2025-10-03

As I read the reviews from google maps, I already have a high expectation on him and his team. They did not disappoint.

My mum and I was like any other tourists in Da Nang, fed up with Banh M. We decided to give this Moroccan restaurant a go. Samir greeted us well and introduced his signature dishes. Emphasised no rush in picking what we want. Can finish a dish before ordering another so to make sure the portion is just right for our stomachs.

One of the best dishes was the lamb meatballs. It was served in a Kefta (not sure it was spelled this way). The aroma from the tomato sauce and the spice found its way into our nostrils after the beautiful Kefta lid was opened. The sauce was truly remarkable. It was so intense and sweet. I reckon it was made from dried or pulped tomatoes. Well-done!

Samir told me he was attacked by Israelites online. The reason being he put on an Palestinian flag in his restaurant next to his beautiful Moroccan flag. He explained he would like to support his fellow muslims. I am no muslim myself but I think hate speech should be banned in restaurant reviews. We are all there for the food, right? Not HATE!

A huge thank you for your warm welcome at your restaurant! We spent a birthday party in a truly exquisite Moroccan setting. As for the dishes we tasted, they were simply delicious. It was a first for each of us to taste Moroccan cuisine, and it was a wonderful discovery.

The hummus, the briwats, and the lamb tagine were all delicious, and what can I say about the chocolate crème brûlée? Yum! Yum!

Luckily, you guided us in our choices because we wouldn't have known what to choose. Your passion for your work and Moroccan cuisine shines through in the welcome you gave us and in every dish we ate.

Thank you again for your hospitality, and we will definitely be back on our next trip.

An additional note: While browsing the reviews on Google Business Profile, I noticed some derogatory and clearly inappropriate comments.

I am convinced that these are fake reviews that in no way reflect the wonderful experience my family and I had at your restaurant. Moreover, reading real reviews from other customers, it's not difficult to distinguish the true from the false.

It's truly a shame to read such unjustified attempts at denigration. I hope Google will see to it that this is corrected.",5,5,5,Dine in,,French,2024-10-03,2025-10-03

I had the pleasure of visiting Bladi Restaurant, and my experience was simply fantastic. The restaurant is beautifully designed and exudes a welcoming atmosphere that invites you to linger.
We both opted for a burger, and I have to say, it was truly delicious. The quality of the ingredients and preparation were top-notch, and every bite was a delight. What truly made my experience special, however, were the conversations we had with the owner afterward. His story and commitment to opening this restaurant were extremely inspiring and demonstrate true passion and dedication. I have great respect for his courage and determination💪

It was a pleasure meeting you.
This personal touch made my visit to Bladi an unforgettable experience.

However, I’m an enthusiast of it, and I’ve eaten hundreds of tajines, couscous dishes, pastillas, bowls of harira, and briouats. So what I’m writing here is my personal opinion, supported by a lot of experience.

In the Bladi restaurant, we ordered a chicken tajine. I must say, the only thing that resembled authentic Moroccan cuisine was the fact that it was slowly cooked in a pot and served in a clay dish. Apart from that, I didn’t feel any of the elements that make Moroccan tajine special: cumin (which is used so abundantly in Morocco that you can even find it on your restaurant’s dining table to season your dish if needed), cinnamon (which adds sweetness to the dish), dried ginger powder, and last but not least, preserved lemon. This is what you would typically get when you dine in Marrakech, Essaouira, or Agadir.

On the other hand, what we received at Bladi was just slowly stewed chicken with a few olives, and that’s it. It lacked the authentic taste of Morocco. It’s a shame…",4,3,4,Dine in,Dinner,,2024-10-03,2025-10-03

Little did we know that our experience would surpass all expectations, creating a memory that would be etched in our hearts forever.

Our evening began with a warm welcome from the owner himself, who took us to our beautifully set table. We were immediately struck by the fragrant aroma of exotic spices that wafted from the open kitchen. The ambiance was set, and our senses were already tingling with anticipation.

Now, let's talk about the star of the evening: the food. The cuisine at Bladi was unlike anything we had ever experienced. Every dish was a symphony of flavors and colors that danced on our taste buds.

One particular highlight was the briwats. They were both savory and sweet, unlike anything I had tasted before. They had a depth of flavor that left us craving more. The presentation of each dish was also a work of art, with vibrant colors and intricate patterns that showcased the culinary skill of the chef.

Speaking of the chef (the owner), we were absolutely touched by his generosity. He surprised us with a stunning bouquet of flowers. They absolutely added an extra layer of romance to our celebration. What made it even more special was that he didn’t charge us a single penny for it. It was a heartfelt gesture that truly made our anniversary unforgettable.

The service throughout the evening was impeccable. The chef was knowledgeable about the menu, offering well thought out recommendations. He was attentive without being intrusive, making us feel like honored guests in his kingdom.

To top it all off, we ended our evening with a decadent dessert that was the perfect finale. I highly recommend the rose crepes, a new addition to the menu. They are unlike anything I have tasted before.

Our anniversary celebration at Bladi was nothing short of magical. The combination of exquisite Moroccan cuisine, a charming ambiance, and the chef's thoughtful gestures made it an evening we will cherish forever. If you're looking for a unique and unforgettable dining experience, look no further than Bladi. We can't wait to return in the near future. Thank you for going above and beyond, and for making our anniversary truly extraordinary!",5,5,5,,,,2023-10-03,2025-10-03

The cuisine is excellent, we loved the concept.
Samir, the chef will be there to advise you, and help you discover the flavors of Morocco in all his dishes. In addition he is extremely kind, we had a superb evening.
Bladi was a great discovery.

Unfortunately the owner is the worst host ever. Very rude and arrogant. If you don’t care about how you are treated and only care about the food i suggest you can go there. But if the way you are treated is also important i suggest you to stay far away from this place. We got insulted by the owner multiple times as we were there. From his reaction on someone’s review here you can see his attitude.

He might understand the concept of moroccan food but he needs to take lessons on the moroccan hospitality. I hope the owner will accept the criticism of his guests and uses it to improve.",1,4,3,Dine in,Dinner,,2023-10-03,2025-10-03

I saw a Google review and it said it was my first time to eat a restaurant like this and it keeps coming to mind.
I went with my girlfriend :)

I definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to experience it.
However, the price is a little high.

The only downside was that there was no air conditioning.
To be honest, I'm not sure about the taste....
I am not the type of person to save money on Michelin-starred restaurants and food.
I am so interested in food that I even write a food blog.
It's not a food that Koreans would particularly like.

Bladi serves delicious Morrocan food cooked with love in a charming little house near My Khe beach (5min walk).

The menu offers options for all kinds of diets, which makes this an excellent choice for a family-style food sharing experience. Definitely come with an appetite.

Everything we ordered was yummy. The chicken tagine was superb. The briswat was an  excellent recommemdation for a starter.  Loved the eggplant caviar dip. We devoured their hearty tomatoe-based soup (forgot the name), but it was a cross between a thick minestrone and chilli. It was a warm hug in a bowl. Don't forget to reward yourself after cleaning off your plates with an order of Morrocan mint tea that comes in a large traditional tea pot.  A great way to sweeten your tooth, freshen your palette and soothe your now stuffed belly.

All the food is genuine and freshly prepared without compromises (you may need to book in advance some special dishes that require long preparation hours).

This is one of the oldest and famous bread shops, crowded every morning with both locals and tourists. The bread here has a crispy, hot crust, full inside with sausage, pate, cold cuts, herbs and special sauce. When eating, you can clearly feel the harmony between the fatty, salty, sweet and aromatic flavors of the ingredients, creating an unforgettable flavor. 

The price of a loaf of bread is about 20,000 - 25,000 VND, in terms of quality, it is completely worth it. The staff works quickly, even though there are many customers, you rarely have to wait too long. The bread is always kept hot, the pate is fragrant, the sausage is thickly sliced, eating one loaf is enough to fill you up for the whole day. 

The only downside is that during peak hours, you have to wait in line for quite a long time, and the pate can be a bit fatty for some people's taste. However, overall, Ba Lan bread is still worth trying when visiting Da Nang.",4,4,4,,Dinner,Vietnamese,2025-09-26,2025-10-03

Tonight I stopped by the store to buy a loaf of bread and saw an uncle sitting at the counter with a crazy Trinh Thuong Cuong look on his face. I said: Uncle, give me a loaf of bread. He didn't even look at me so I thought maybe I should wait my turn to order cake. When it was my turn, I ordered a loaf of bread, but when my friend put the loaf of bread in a paper bag, I asked him to cut the loaf of bread in half. That's all he cursed: D Why didn't I say it first? It was a waste of time because his shop also had 2 people behind me. Mom, cutting a loaf of bread takes less than 2 seconds, it's no big deal to curse customers like that. I also looked at him with disdain because of his uncultured words. He also tried to look back at me and kept saying D M, why don't you say it over and over again. I told my child to wait for his turn and then speak because talking to him would be impolite to previous customers. He didn't listen and just kept cursing 🤣 with this tone, he's probably not from Da Nang but he came from somewhere else to start a business. I'm okay but I just feel sorry for the people who work here who must hear harsh words every day.
You should re-learn your education and then be your own boss🤣. I hope everyone will consider it fairly and come to this bakery. People like him probably don't have the heart to make clean food.

but the arrogant attitude, looking down on tourists is not pleasant. I am a tourist, passing by and stopping to buy, from the owner to the staff all look down on customers. I just opened my mouth to order 3 loaves without having time to tell them anything, then jumped into the customer's throat, didn't care what kind the customer ordered, made it myself and charged 25k (while I was planning to order 35k loaves to see how it was). Then this staff pushed it to another staff, no one wanted to make the bread. When the owner counted the bill, when she heard that my voice was not from Da Nang, she spoke in a very unpleasant tone, and threw the change on the table. While waiting for the bread, a Da Nang woman came, the owner's tone was completely different ""yours is..., please give me the change"" and handed it to me. I was completely different, while I also bought and paid, but it seemed like they didn't like tourists here. I will never come again. I haven't eaten the bread yet but I'm already angry.
Extremely disrespectful to customers, from owners to employees. Sell without customers

The simple reason was because she had to cut the bread in half. The man (I don't know if it was the owner) used harsh words to insult my sister and forced all the customers waiting to buy his bread to hear the two words (fuck) repeatedly. I felt like the saliva and all the vulgarity in his mouth had overflowed into all the toppings that the shop was using to put on the bread for the customers. As a businessman and in the field of customer care. I always honor, respect and treat my customers as gods. So I strongly condemn his uncivilized behavior, especially directly with customers, who bring income and success to the business. I share it here for the shop owner to see, for everyone to see, and for him to see, then reflect and change his mindset to overcome and help the shop become more successful. I know everyone has times when they are impulsive, impatient and can't control their emotions, but the way he showed it was so obvious and disrespectful to others, everyone standing there felt uncomfortable and offended. Customers, income sources, the success or failure of the restaurant are treated like that, I myself am confused about where his heart is in doing his job.

Feeling hungry after dinner, I decided to grab takeout to eat at the hotel. They had an English menu, and ordering was a breeze.

Finally, I asked about the amount of chili sauce, added it, and then it was ready in the oven.
It looked so delicious and filling, I couldn't resist taking a bite. The combination of the crispy baguette and the filling was amazing, and it might be the best banh mi I've ever had.

The contents were just okay, but the baguette was perfectly soft on the outside and crispy on the inside. The taste is just like a local banh mi. It's always bustling with locals in the afternoon. When ordering, they ask if you want it spicy, and I personally think it tastes better when it's spicy. However, the ham has a fishy smell?, so people with sensitive skin might want to avoid it.

The roasted pork here is roasted suckling pig, so it's more special than other places.
The bread doesn't have onions and cilantro like in Saigon, but instead has perilla and Vietnamese coriander. The perilla flavor is quite strong and spicy, so it goes well with roasted pork, creating a very strange feeling when biting into the bread.
The roasted pork bread here also doesn't have soy sauce like in Saigon, but salt and pepper.

The lady asked if we wanted chilli and we nodded our heads to our surprise she doused it with chilli oil. We timidly bit into the sandwich unsure of what to expect. It was amazing! Fresh, not to spicy and great flavour.

Including myself, there were only 2 customers.  In my quest to find great pho, based on reviews and the fact that Mr Que advertised one of my favorites (Pho Gau, brisket pho), the large bowl was ordered.  I like brisket because of the flavorful fat.  However, I was disappointed that it had hardly any fat and was more like pho bo (beef pho).  Also, the actual size (more like a medium), amount and type of noodles (very thin), and lack of flavor in the broth.  I'm sorry but I cannot recommend pho here.  I've had pho many times over the years and in several countries.  So far, the best pho has been in the USA. I'm yet to find impressive noodle soup in Vietnam.",5,3,4,,Dinner,,2025-09-19,2025-10-03

However compared to places like Ho Chi Minh city there are some key differences. We ordered drinks and there was no ice which is usually available. Additionally there was no hoisin sauce for pho here which is a crucial part of having pho. The amount of food served in the pho was a lot smaller than can be found in other places while costing much more, likely because this is a tourist heavy area next to the beach. A special pho was 75K VND, so about 3 USD. There were 2 waitresses however only one of the workers was working while the other one seemed to be worried about online matters. The pho itself was okay, however the sauce would have made it much better. On the upside there is air conditioning.",1,4,2,,Brunch,,2025-08-03,2025-10-03

5265,ChdDSUhNMG9nS0VQcjVrNnVzNzR6NXdRRRAB,43,Martin Trịnh,5 reviews · 1 photo,1.0,3 months ago,"ENGLISH VERSION BELOW

The staff's face was swollen like a pump, I called 3-4 times for a piece of lemon but it was like calling into the void - no response, no glance. I ordered 2 bowls of pho with 2 bowls of poached eggs and received the haunting combo: cold pho broth, poached eggs that were raw and had a grin, the egg whites were still clear - it tasted fishy and nauseating.

As for the pho broth... I really don't know what to call it. It was as bland as snail broth diluted with tap water, like the leftover broth from yesterday was added to make it enough. I've never seen such a bland, soulless bowl of pho in my life.

The restaurant's space was beyond words - it was so hot that there wasn't even a fan, flies were flying around like an open-air market. I had to keep chasing the flies away while eating, it felt like I was eating in a garbage dump and not a restaurant.

Honestly, only easy-going Westerners could swallow this kind of food and praise it as delicious. Vietnamese people only eat this once and then say goodbye.

The shop looks clean at first glance.

English:

The staff looked like they lost a bet just showing up to work. Called out 3-4 times asking for a slice of lime, got absolutely nothing. No response, no eye contact, like we didn't exist.

We ordered two bowls of pho and two soft-boiled eggs, and what we got was straight-up disgusting. The broth was cold, the eggs were practically raw, the whites were still transparent, and the smell was nauseating.

As for the pho broth… I don't even know what to call it. It tasted like leftover soup diluted with tap water. No flavor, no depth, just bland, lifeless water pretends to be broth. I swear, I've never had pho this tasteless in my entire life.

The restaurant was itself a disaster. No fans in sight, it was like sitting in a sauna. Flies were everywhere, you literally had to keep swatting them away while trying to eat. Felt more like eating in a dump than an actual restaurant.

Honestly, only clueless tourists would think this place is ""authentic"" or ""delicious."" No self-respecting local will come back after this kind of experience.

Never coming back. Ever",2,1,3,,,Vietnamese,2025-07-03,2025-10-03

* The rooftop space is spacious and airy, you can watch the fireworks while going to the festival.
* The design has a religious feel, impressive.
* Bill for 4 people \~1.2 million.
* Recommend pandan rice with cheese, stir-fried vermicelli, crispy fried mushrooms - vegetarian dishes but rich in flavor.
* The staff are generally friendly.

Cons:
There was a guy in a black shirt, wearing glasses who answered a bit curtly, which ruined the mood.

Quang was outstanding!

The food is creative and fresh, but some mixes felt heavy. For example, one salad combined lettuce, watermelon, cherry tomato, and radish. Another mixed peanuts, fried noodles, mushrooms, and pickled cucumbers. I also tried fried mushrooms with pickled hot pepper and green peppercorns.

Individually, all were tasty, but together the combinations can challenge digestion. As a biohacker, I felt a bit bloated afterward, likely from fruit mixed with heavier foods. Simplifying or separating ingredients could make the dishes lighter and even more energizing.

Some warning the class is more of a cooking demonstration however we still enjoyed it. You can ask questions and get a booklet of the recipes. We were able to practice rolling the spring rolls and cooking the banh xeo. The chef Dinh made some delicious food and Tan took almost 100 photos and videos for us which she air dropped.

As soon as we arrived, we were greeted by young, friendly staff who escorted us to our table on the terrace. Quang is an excellent restaurant manager: polite, kind, and precise, he also made the right recommendations based on our tastes. The view, spanning the river and the downtown skyline, is breathtaking. We ordered several dishes, all of which received top marks. Honorable mention goes to the grilled tofu. It's no coincidence that this restaurant is also featured in the 2025 Michelin Guide. It deserves it. Highly recommended.

The place is quite lovely and comfortable. The food was great, really fresh and we enjoyed all the dishes we shared but unfortunately the service let down the whole experience.
Whenever we ordered a drink we would then need to order it again with another wait person who came to the table to retake the order, after which it looked like they were having a conference meeting about it and then it either came after a long wait or we had to chase it up again.
Very strange considering we were ordering things on their actual menu and pointing to it and using translate app…. So language barriers aside it’s just really terrible slow service. But food was lovely.",1,5,4,,Dinner,,2025-09-03,2025-10-03

Celebrating a birthday milestone, we are soooo glad that we chose Shamballa to dine at. 5 stars aren't enough; 20 stars in total (5 from each of our party of four).

From the welcome to the very last bite, everything was perfect. Grateful that we got to try a fair few of the dishes on the menu -- the selection was overwhelming! Looking forward to coming back and sampling other dishes! Of note: the smashed rice paper mushroom salad, the crispy abalone mushrooms, the chilli sprinkled fried tofu (my personal favourite), and the wild vegetables sauteed with garlic as recommended by our exceptionally wonderful waiter, Tran Phuong Dung! Shout-out to this lovely young lady, Dung, for looking after us all evening and the exacting and effortless service. You are a gem 💎 and we all greatly appreciate you! 🙏❤️ Thank you for making our evening so enjoyable and relaxed.

We had an avid meat-eater in our group and even they were seriously impressed by the flavours and presentation of the dishes. Kudos and huge thanks to the kitchen staff, too. An absolutely beautifully crafted and delicious meal.

Bar staff: whatever you're doing, please continue doing that! Cocktails, mocktails, mojitos were gorgeously presented and so tasty.

The rooftop is a particular highlight: stylishly furnished, with plenty of greenery, cozy lighting, and a sweeping view of the city—perfect for unwinding.

The food is not only exclusively vegetarian, but also perfectly balanced—fresh, creative, and prepared with love. The menu is varied, and the cocktails are sophisticated and well-mixed. Anyone who thinks meat-free is boring will be very pleasantly surprised.

The team is young, warm, and dedicated. Even if it takes a few minutes longer now and then, you can feel that everyone is enjoying themselves and is attentive. And let's be honest: you're on vacation—so sit back, enjoy, and breathe deeply.

A place to feel good—with soul, style, and taste. Ideal for a relaxed dinner with a special flair. Be sure to head up to the rooftop and experience the tranquility above the city.",5,5,5,,Dinner,German,2025-08-03,2025-10-03

You can easily spend a million and not even get a cup of tea or water, and anyone traveling through Vietnam knows this is a very common practice here.
Look at the restaurant's responses to negative reviews; it says a lot about the restaurant's policy!

Based on the response I received to my comment above, I changed my rating. One star is sufficient, being kind.

What you called ""vague defamation"" was the result of my experience with you, and the feedback you gave me only proves what I and many others have reported.
Now, based on the experience here in the comments: you don't know how to take criticism and are aggressive with customers. You didn't respond to anything I put forward, just trying to discredit me and my experience.
The negative comments are still from CUSTOMERS who visited, ate, didn't like it, and PAID. Accept the criticism and improve.

EDIT:

Wow! Your response is absolutely appalling and you should be ashamed. We arrived at 6:15pm, not 6:40pm and we were never shown to a table nor were we requesting a rooftop patio table. You must be thinking of another customer, which would indicate that we are not the only ones who felt this way. We would have been quite happy to sit inside without a view as we knew we were there too early to see the fireworks. But to pay 300,000 VND each on top of the price of our meal is ridiculous. Had we wanted to sit on the rooftop to watch the fireworks then yes, we would understand the additional charge. We have been to your restaurant before as well as taken your cooking class. But this just feels like a greedy money grab.

EDIT #2:

It looks like you completely edited your initial response so as to not come off looking too bad. Bottom line, we were told there would be a cover charge to dine with you tonight. We were not presented with any other options, so we choose to leave. Your reply to the complaint was unprofessional and you were the one who escalated and made it personal.

From the moment we walked in, the staff warmly greeted us and promptly guided us to our table. The temperature was just right, adding to the comfort of the evening.

The food and drinks truly impressed us — very flavorful, creative, and far from boring. We felt fully satisfied. The overall vibe suited a vegetarian restaurant perfectly: calm, unpretentious, and welcoming. The view from the top floor was fantastic for watching the fireworks — definitely a highlight.

If there’s room for improvement, it would be the elevator access to the top floor and the comfort of the chairs. Also, when the place was full, my second drink order took a while to arrive — it felt like a bit of a stress test for the staff.

Final Verdict:

Service: A- (attentive, friendly, professional)
Vibe: A (relaxed, unpretentious, fitting for a vegetarian spot)
Comfort: B+ (good ambiance and setting, but chairs and access could be improved)
Food & Beverage: A (delicious, well-balanced, memorable presentation)

Duy's recommendations were spot-on, and his genuine passion for hospitality shone through in every interaction.

We ordered a few more dishes because it was our first time dining there, however the eggplant and banh hoi la lot wasn’t to our liking. I think we weren’t used to the eggplant having a strong smoky flavour; I usually enjoy my eggplant on the sweeter side.
The la lot tasted a bit odd to us. We felt it wasn’t cooked enough because it was quite soft, we did raise this with our waiter (who was really great) who said it was the way it was cooked so perhaps again the mushroom mixture they used just wasn’t to our taste.
The bank xeo we had was nice but it wasn’t amazing.
We also ordered a bowl of pho and it again was nice, it satisfied the craving I had for a soup kind of dish.
Overall, we had a good experience. Cannot fault the service and the atmosphere there.
We came back again for dinner just for the mushrooms 👌

The price is of course higher than street food, but there is a reason for that. The amazing view from the rooftop terrace, the nicely decorated restaurant and the hugely diverse vegetarian menu are not even the highlights of the restaurant. When you step inside, you feel like royalty! My wife and I were treated wonderfully and the staff was definitely the friendliest I have ever encountered in Vietnam.

The taste of my own food (mozzarella and rice dish) was perhaps not the tastiest ever, but that was just down to the portion selection.

If you are a vegetarian or even vegan, this is where you want to eat. Or even if you are not. Here is a reason to try something new.",5,5,5,,Dinner,,2025-04-03,2025-10-03

While the service was very good, everyone was very friendly, and the atmosphere was nice, I found the food to fall fairly flat in terms of flavour.

I really love the assortment and the unique dishes, but perhaps I was unlucky with my selection.

The brown fried rice had almost no flavour and the tofu scallops really just tasted like tofu with a bit of bland sauce. The coconut pancakes and the clay pot noodles were pretty good, but not 150k each good.

Unfortunately I feel like I can only give a 3.5 for eveything because of the price. We paid 1,000,000 for 2 rice dishes, 2 appetizers, 1 mocktail and a glass of wine.

A tad bit more expensive compared to other vegetarian restaurants. I suppose you pay for the ambience. According to my husband, you can taste the vegetables in the food. The menu is not trying to pass off as some plant-base alternatives to meat dishes.

We visited this place twice and our mind was blown equally both times.

The chef is a culinary genius, and we absolutely loved how they used mushrooms, tofu, and Eggplant as a substitute of meat in all the dishes.

We ordered the items below:

1. Summer rolls: The rolls were soo green and healthy. The addition of mint leaves gave a refreshing flavour.

2. Three layer tofu: crunchiness from cucumbers and crispness from fried tofu.

3. Fried Rice: Though a common dish in India, we were amazed how the addition of certain vegetables and cheese can enhance the taste to another level.

4. Cheese baked mushroom oyster:
They served mushrooms baked in cheese inside an artificial oyster on a bed of sea salt with the intention of providing a real experience of eating Oysters to vegetarians.

5. Seared Tofu: Roasted Tofu with crunchy veggies

6. Grilled Eggplant: Beautiful roasted eggplant with peanuts and mushrooms

The ambience and view from the rooftop space is 10 /10.

The staff were attentive and polite, and spoke good English.

The meal was lovely and balanced; well seasoned and beautifully presented. We did take pictures of the food, but given that the official pictures online look exactly like the food we were served, there's no need for us to duplicate. The meal really is exactly how it looks!

Burgers? Pile 'em high. So, trying a vegetarian restaurant for New Year's Eve was... well, a leap of faith. But boy, did we land on cloud nine!

The ""wonderful wonderful taste"" wasn't just hype. Every bite was a symphony of vibrant seasoning and creative textures. The Satay Mushroom was a revelation – smoky, sweet, and oh-so-meaty (in the best plant-based way). And the 3-layer tofu? Forget tofu, that was pure magic – pillowy soft inside, crispy on the outside, and bursting with savory goodness. Even my grandma, the fussiest eater, couldn't stop praising it.

Now, let's address the elephant in the herb garden: the price. Yes, it's not your average diner fare. But hear me out – the experience we had was priceless. The explosion of flavors, the joy of discovering new favorites, the shared family moment of stepping outside our comfort zone? Worth every penny.

However, I gotta be honest – the desserts and drinks left me a little deflated. They were good, sure, but not mind-blowing, and definitely not worth the premium price tag. Stick to the star of the show – the incredible food!

**Final verdict:** Carnivores, vegetarians, and everyone in between – listen up! If you're looking for a tastebud adventure, Shamballa is your holy grail. Just skip the overpriced sweet endings and focus on the plant-powered perfection they dish up. Your taste buds (and maybe even your grandma) will thank you.

**Rating:** 5/5 for the food, 3/5 for the desserts and drinks. Overall, a plant-powered paradise!

**P.S.** Don't be shy, fellow meat-eaters! Embrace the veggie journey – you might just surprise yourself.",5,5,4,Dine in,Dinner,,2024-10-03,2025-10-03

It may look pretty but it's lacking the passion and flavour.

We had to leave 2 out of the 3 dishes, as they were not good. The food looks beautiful but it's lacking in so many departments.

The woven noodles were a non-starter, the mock-meat incredibly underseasoned, had a horrible texture. I had to leave most of ths dish. You can get a much better option inrestaurants for a fraction of the price here (usually paying 55k for something like this, here it was 125k)

Whereas breadfruit was well seasoned, great start - but if you know breadfruit it is an incredibly dry and starchy fruit - best served with a sauce on the side or a condiment. Was it served with a condiment? No, it was dry breadfruit. Go to Indonesia, they'll do it properly for you.

The tofu came out tasting of fish, of course it's a vegetarian restaurant - so it's clearly seaweed that was used in the same oil to fry the tofu. The tofu tasted very fried without much seasoning, they stuck some fried crunchy bits on top which had bits of chilli which were good but not much else.

The staff were incredibly friendly though. I did let the staff know, that they were great - but the food was unfortunately not. It really wasn't good. In all my years in Asia, I've never left dishes like that.

I hope they can take this as a critique on those dishes and work on them - they need more flavour. Channel that Vietnamese flavour!

PS - They do not bother to serve you water. Not serving water with the meal is outrageous when you're paying 500k. How can a restaurant where we pay 40k for two meals serve water/tea but a restaurant where we pay 500k can't even serve a courtesy glass of water.",2,2,2,,,,2023-10-03,2025-10-03

Review of A Tai Restaurant - Needs to improve many aspects
I had the opportunity to visit A Tai restaurant, but this time the experience was quite disappointing.
1. About the food: Not to my personal taste, perhaps due to regional differences, so I cannot accurately evaluate the overall quality.
2. Space: The restaurant has a strange, unpleasant odor. Some corners of the restaurant are quite dirty, creating an unclean feeling when dining.
3. Service attitude: The staff are quite indifferent, after serving the dishes, they gather and sit near the fan and focus on their phones, not paying attention to customers who need support.
Suggestion: The management should review the way they operate and train staff to improve the experience for diners.
I really hope the restaurant will have more positive changes in the future. Just to press the phone, the manager needs to review the way the staff takes care of customers.",1,3,2,,Lunch,Vietnamese,2025-08-03,2025-10-03

It seemed like he was introducing it to me by giving me a tip.

I ordered fried ribs? Morning Glory, and steamed chicken.
The rice came out like a clay pot, and it was like flying rice, but it was delicious and perfect for when you miss Korean food! I think the ribs would be okay for kids to eat (be careful with the bones..) The Vietnamese chicken is very chewy like native chicken, but since it comes with salt and pepper, it was like boiled chicken without soup.😄😄
Most of the menu wasn't translated, so it was hard, but they also sell seaweed soup and rice (20,000 dong per piece), so it would be good to come here when you want to eat something less spicy!
They gave me watermelon as a service after eating my rice, and it wasn't lukewarm, but refreshing and sweet.

The river view made the meal even more delicious.
I had lamb stew, shrimp stew, fried rice, naan (bread), and lassi (drink).
The lamb stew was my favorite, so I ordered another bowl and finished three.

The menu offers a wide range of choices, from side dishes to main courses, and their Masala selection is especially impressive. I didn’t realize there were so many kinds of Masala—it felt like a whole new world of flavors to explore. Even something as simple as rice comes in different varieties, so you can really enjoy picking what suits your taste.

I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, and it was sumptuous—easily one of the best I’ve had, ranking as my top two. I paired it with white rice, and the serving was very generous. Since I was eating alone, I quickly realized the portions are big enough for two, which worked out well because I was able to take the rest to go and save it for dinner. Their orange juice was also refreshing and pure. You can really taste how fresh their ingredients are—the herbs and spices are top-notch, and the chicken tasted farm-fresh, not just “refrigerator fresh.”

Service was great. The staff were accommodating, quick to serve, and very friendly. It didn’t take long for my food to arrive, and it was easy to communicate since they understood simple English. The menu is also in English, which makes the place very foreigner-friendly.

For the price, it’s good value for money. While it might feel a little expensive if you’re dining alone, the large portions make it worthwhile, especially if you share with someone or plan to take the rest home.

The tables are well-equipped with amenities, and the location itself is convenient. It’s easy to find and accessible through Grab, which makes getting there hassle-free.

Overall, it was a wonderful dining experience. I’ll definitely be back to try more of their dishes.",4,4,3,,,,2025-09-26,2025-10-03

Absolutely amazing Indian cuisine in Da Nang!
After 4 days in Vietnam (Da Nang City), my family and I were craving something different — and Mama Masala truly delivered! The food was incredibly delicious, rich in flavor, and beautifully presented. This place offers one of the best Indian fusion dining experiences we've ever had.

The service was warm and attentive, and the ambiance was cozy and inviting.
I highly recommend this spot to anyone who loves authentic Indian food or wants to try something uniquely flavorful while in Da Nang.

A must-visit restaurant — 5 stars well deserved!

After we finished eating, we asked for the bill and the Biryani was not recorded. When I asked him about it, he said he would go and get it for me. I said no, we have finished dinner and you were busy with the Indian customers? The evaluation is based on the taste of the food as the chicken had a bad smell.

I think the prices are also more reasonable than other Indian restaurants in Da Nang.
I like Vietnam and that's why I moved to Vietnam but I had one big problem; there are fewer Indian restaurants which serve authentic Indian foods with reasonable prices ( so I appreciate this Indian restaurant ) .

But I personally wish the staff members would refrain from repeatedly walking around, coming back and forth again and again in the diving space because otherwise I cannot feel comfortable or  relaxed ( I am not sure why they do so but I am sure almost all people in my country do not like it. ).",,5,,,,,2025-03-03,2025-10-03

I ordered the Aloo Paratha and Paneer Biryani, and both dishes were a testament to authentic Indian flavors. The Aloo Paratha was perfectly cooked—crispy on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside, and paired beautifully with their tangy and well-spiced aachar.

The Paneer Biryani was equally impressive. The rice was fragrant, fluffy, and infused with perfectly balanced spices, while the paneer was soft and fresh, adding a delightful richness. To round off the meal, I ordered a hot cup of chai, which provided a comforting warmth—especially soothing as it rained outside. It was the perfect end to a delightful dining experience.

The friendly staff and cozy ambiance made the experience even better. If you're in Vietnam and craving authentic Indian cuisine, Mama Masala is a must-visit. I can’t wait to return and explore more of their menu!",5,5,5,Dine in,Lunch,,2025-01-03,2025-10-03

From the photos, you can see they also served mango pickles, sour cream, and some crispy rice paper as extras, which added a lovely touch to the meal. The food was fresh and full of authentic spices, and every bite was a treat.

The service was exceptional—friendly, attentive, and professional. The staff speaks English very well, which made communication easy and enjoyable. The restaurant itself is spotless, creating a warm and welcoming atmosphere.

Tamilvanan and his Vietnamese attendant was friendly and attentive, offering insightful suggestions.
We had food for 4 days (lunch and dinner), breakfast was complimentary in the hotel where we stayed, else we would have had breakfast in Mama Masala itself. The food was delicious and we almost had all the menu in the restaurant (south and north indian cuisine).
The price point was reasonable, when compared to other Indian restaurants. Overall, we had a good delicious food with courteous server.

This is my second visit to this wonderful Indian restaurant in Da Nang, and it has certainly lived up to my expectations once again! From the exceptional service to the warm and inviting ambiance, everything about this place makes it a standout choice for Indian cuisine lovers.

Food:

Gobi 65 (4.75/5) – A crispy, flavorful dish that’s perfectly spiced. The cauliflower was fried to perfection, and the seasoning was spot on. A great start to the meal.

Chilli Paneer (5/5) – Absolutely fantastic! The paneer was soft and juicy, and the balance of flavors—spicy, tangy, and slightly sweet—was incredible. One of the best I’ve had outside of India!

Mutton Biryani (5/5) – If you’re a biryani lover, this is a must-try! The mutton was tender, and the biryani itself was packed with aromatic spices and flavors. Definitely one of the best biryanis I’ve had in Da Nang.

Chicken Biryani (4.5/5) – Very flavorful, with perfectly cooked chicken and a great mix of spices. Though it was slightly less fragrant than the mutton version, it was still delicious and satisfying.

Vegetable Biryani (4/5) – A solid vegetarian option, though I personally preferred the non-veg versions. The vegetables were fresh, and the rice was flavorful, but I felt it could use a little more seasoning.

Paneer Biryani (4.25/5) – A unique and tasty option for paneer lovers. The paneer was soft and complemented the spices well, but it was slightly milder than I expected. Still, a great dish.

Butter Milk (5/5) – Refreshing and cooling, just as it should be. Perfect to balance out the spices and the richness of the biryanis. One of the best butter milks I’ve had!

Masala Chai (5/5) – A lovely, aromatic masala chai to finish the meal. The spices were perfectly blended, and it was served hot and fresh.

Service & Ambience:

The service here is top-notch. The staff is incredibly friendly and attentive, always ready to offer recommendations or adjust the spice levels according to your preference. The ambience is cozy and welcoming, making it the perfect spot to enjoy a meal with family or friends.

Conclusion:

This restaurant continues to be my go-to place for authentic Indian food in Da Nang. The quality of the food, the warmth of the staff, and the overall dining experience make it a must-visit for anyone craving delicious Indian dishes. Highly recommend it!",5,5,5,Dine in,Lunch,,2024-12-03,2025-10-03

I recently had the pleasure of dining at Mama Masala, and it was an experience to remember! From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with warmth, and the ambiance beautifully captured the essence of Indian culture with its authentic decor and soothing music.

The food was absolutely phenomenal! Every dish we ordered was bursting with flavors, beautifully presented, and perfectly spiced. The Butter Chicken was a standout – rich, creamy, and cooked to perfection. The freshly baked naan was fluffy and paired wonderfully with the curries. To top it off, the Gulab Jamun provided a delightful sweet ending to an already perfect meal.

What truly elevated the experience was the impeccable service. The staff at Mama Masala were attentive, friendly, and went above and beyond to ensure every guest felt special.

Normally, I try new restaurants daily to better understand food, culture, execution, and to keep up with my knowledge of the industry. I rarely get surprised. Today was a surprise.

Although I came to the restaurant unannounced, the staff were immediately ready to seat me and assured me that I was in for a nice meal.

From the start, they brought out a basket of bread with premium beurre d’Isigny. Quite surprising to see such premium products being have to customers in Vietnam.

I ordered the scallops, their lowest priced beef steak, as well as a Caesar salad and a chocolate fondant.

All turned out well. Steak was a little bit undercooked (MR vs M), but I can understand the reluctance of the chef to go to far with such a cut of meat. Either way, it still turned out pretty good!

Da Nang is not known for its supply of cheese, and I think they use the have used the best ingredients possible in the Caesar salad; every single bite had bacon, you could taste the anchovies, and there was plenty of Parmesan, although not exactly the aged variety we might see in Bangkok or Hong Kong.

Scallops were fairly large gauge and good value for money.

Steak was great value for money as well and I can’t wait to try the whole range on subsequent visits.

It was really nice to be offered a top up of my bread basket by the staff mid-meal, and it was equally nice to be offered a complementary café by owner Vinh in the end.

Before that farewell café, though, I had the chocolate fondant. This one was particularly excellent. Not the mass-market variety you see in a lot of restaurants (and a number of five-star hotels).

Some thought has been put into the selection of this desert and as a result, it really topped off a great dinner.

Recipes are solid, products are good, pricing is fair.

5/5 and an exceptionally friendly owner.

Firstly, the place is hot even with a few air conditions. My wife had to use her small portable fan the whole time dining there. Staff saw her but did not even bother asking or switching place or even bring out a portable cooler/fan. The place is not crowded, the whole time we were there, only 3 tables including ours and it was a Friday night.

After we were done with our meal, one of the staff came to ask for our feedbacks on our meal (read: we did not complain, we were asked for feedbacks). We gave our honest feedbacks on how we truly felt. When we asked for the bill, the owner (French men I believed) came and was surprised that we were unhappy with the meal. He started to challenge our tastebuds and made us felt as if we had no right to comment. Note to the owner: if you are not ready for any constructive feedbacks, DO NOT allow your staffs to ask the customers.

1. French snails: tasteless. He told us how French snails supposed to taste and that all his snails are imported from France and that he sold more than 200 plates a month. We seriously do not care how many plates you sold per month, we thought the dish could be improved.

2. Duck breast with orange sauce. Duck breast was chewy and tasteless where the duck was not marinated enough.

3. Seafood pasta. Cream sauce with the miserable small prawns and some squids. Chewy and over cooked.

4. Drinks. We requested for warm water as my wife is pregnant. We were given a bottle of mineral water and the price was the same as my tiger beer.

5. The only good thing about our meal was the lobster soup.

It was our worst meal in Da Nang especially after speaking to the owner, we felt insulted. The price we paid wasn't cheap and it definitely did not worth the price no matter the food, service or ambiance. I'm sure the owner wouldn't be happy with this review and I could see how he handled bad comments online from other patrons. Definitely not going back and definitely do not recommend anyone going.

The location of it is tricky but obvious because they have a sign at the corner already. We took grab car to the entrance of the alley and walked in. We arrived at around 5:15pm. The server showed us the special menu on a little black board of that day. We ordered lobster soup, beef carpaccio, goat cheese salad, lamb fillet and cod. The soup tasted amazingly good. The beef carpaccio is a big plate with slices of cheese on top. Eat them together to avoid the bland  taste of the beef. The salad and cod are also nice but the highlight of the night was the lamb fillet. I ordered it medium and it was cooked perfectly. It was juicy and really tender. Not dry and chewy at all. Highly recommend. The environment makes the diners feel comfortable . It is not really grand and scared you away that kind of restaurant. The price is not too high and reasonable.

Location: Place is on the main road, facing the han river, very near to Dragon bridge. Easy to access and find.
The food: We tried mixed grill platter, Falafel wrap, mandi rice and Banh mi along with fresh coconuts. Falafel wrap was the best item with Falafel freshly fried. Banh Mi was also good with succulent, juicy chicken pieces inside. Mix grill.platter contained sheesh kebabs, chicken kebab, beef kebab with a bit of salad and rice. Kebabs were good but beef was quite dry and rough with a little of smell too. Mandi rice was quite disappointing as rice were oozing water and in first round chicken was not properly heated. We asked the dish to be reheated which was dine promptly. Portions were decent. Mix platter portion was a bit less while mandi rice portion was quite large.
Ambience: Nice and clean. Not too fancy but quite pleasing to eyes.
Service: Service was super good with staff very responsive and quick. Food arrived quite quickly too.
Price: A sumptuous dinner for 3 costed 1020000 Dongs (~50 SGD) which isn't that expensive.
Overall a good option if you want halal food in Da Nang.",5,4,5,Dine in,Dinner,,2025-10-04,2025-10-04

The meal itself was good, and the pho was delicious, but the service could seriously improve.
The waiter was apathetic and even told customers they couldn't use the air conditioner.

Dining in such hot weather was a very uncomfortable experience.

I just wanted to enjoy a bowl of pho, but the service was so disappointing that it ruined my overall experience.

I hope the restaurant will pay more attention to customer experience and improve its service.",,,,,,Chinese,2025-10-04,2025-10-04

The pancakes were skillfully poured, the crust was very thin, crispy from the inside out. The filling was full of fresh shrimp, pork belly, bean sprouts and green beans. In particular, the shrimp here is very firm and sweet, served with fresh green vegetables and a special sweet and sour fish sauce. The fish sauce was mixed very well, not too salty or too bland, helping to balance the flavor of the pancakes. Just one bite and you can feel all the quintessence of this dish. This is a must-visit address if you are a fan of Western pancakes.",,,,,,Vietnamese,2025-09-20,2025-10-04

When i walked in, the AC wasnt working properly but the staff's smile really cool me off. They suggest me their signature dish, ""Pho Dac Biet"" bowl, I was eager to have some and they quickly served it hot and steamy.
*TASTE: It's 9/10 for me, it wasn't perfect, but I could feel the Vietnamese love in the bowl, warm and welcome. The soup was seasoned just right, the beef was cooked on point and when you dipped them in the sauce, it was superb. The down point was the AC so hot, combine with hot Pho, I was sweating all over the place.

The pairings included not only wine but also popular Japanese sake brands like ""Senkin"" and ""Saku,"" which complemented the food perfectly.

The staff's thoughtfulness was particularly impressive. They realized our limited English skills and even created Japanese descriptions using ChatGPT to show us. Their attentive service truly represents first-class service.

Led by the visionary Chef Summer Le, Nén Danang is not just a meal; it's a narrative journey through the essence of Vietnamese culture and its rich culinary heritage.

The Soulful Cuisine
At the core of Nén Danang's philosophy is its ""Conscious Cuisine"" and signature ""Sto:ry Menus."" Chef Summer Le, an acclaimed food blogger turned chef-owner, meticulously crafts tasting menus that are woven with storytelling elements. Each menu delivers a main concept supported by smaller narratives within each course, with a goal to promote kind thoughts and feelings. The restaurant prides itself on using 99% hyper-local ingredients, often sourced directly from its own farm located right in front of the restaurant, ensuring unparalleled freshness and authenticity.

Nén Danang aims to explore the vast potential of Vietnamese ingredients and culture, without resorting to ""borrowing"" elements from other cuisines. Chef Le believes in the intrinsic strength of Vietnamese flavors, proving that exquisite and beautiful dishes can be created solely from the bounty of Vietnam's land. The menu is regularly tweaked every few months and completely revamped every six months to keep it fresh and exciting, reflecting seasonal produce and new culinary inspirations.

Guests can expect creative Vietnamese dishes that include:

Refined versions of local specialties: Elevating familiar tastes with meticulous techniques and artistic presentation.

Bold creations: Such as complex beef noodle soups with intense, slow-cooked broths, or creatively aged duck dishes.

Unique flavor combinations: Like anchovy sauce paired with pineapple and meat, showcasing unexpected harmonies.

Each dish often comes with a hand-drawn card explaining its inspiration and ingredients, deepening the immersive ""story"" experience.

Minimalist Ambiance with a Natural Connection

When was the last time you ate there?

I thought restaurants offering such an incredible experience were only found in big cities like Kuala Lumpur or Bangkok, so I was honestly surprised to find a place like this in Da Nang.

Nen's ambiance, concept, service, and cuisine are all so refined.

Even among Michelin-starred sustainable restaurants, Nen particularly values local production and consumption, and the land and culinary culture of Vietnam. Your journey begins with an aperitif and an explanation of the ingredients used that day.

The dishes, which are all made with Vietnamese ingredients, are based on French cuisine but are unique and have been elevated to Vietnamese cuisine. You'll be surprised and impressed time and time again by the flavors that are beyond your imagination just by looking at them.

While the food descriptions are in English, Japanese descriptions are displayed on every plate, so even those who aren't fluent in English will enjoy themselves.

It is not very often that one gets the opportunity to eat beautifully crafted Southeast Asian cuisine at this high level, unpretentious and yet very proudly Asian in flavour and taste.

We were so impressed with the variety of local produce showcased in their 9 course ‘Omakase’ meal which is aptly named ‘Nen’s food story journey’.     Ms Summer Le, the owner , should be applauded for formulating such a wonderful menu of taste and discovery highlighting the best of Danang and Vietnam’s culinary heritage.

Her choice of Sakes and wines were spot-on and logical for what would best pair our Southeast Asian spices and produce but an Asian beverage like Sake and Australian wines ,  which have such a good reputation in complementing our Asian palate.

Nen’s service staff, though youthful, were by no means naive.  Their knowledge of the ingredients, the food preparation and how to partake each course should be commended. Unlike other high end places, the waiters particularly Ms Sky , were not ostentatiously
professional  but down-to earth and enthusiastic about their restaurant and food.  It was so refreshing to be served by her.

The highlight of our experience that night was Nen’s house-made  liquor which we found out was made from a local miniature spring onion called ‘Nen’.   It was surprisingly fresh, sweet and tarty. Such a creative streak to make a liquor out of a simple bulb!  It definitely closed the chapter to our wonderful food-journey on a high note.

Thank you Nen , Ms Sky and her team  for making our wedding anniversary a truly memorable occasion!
We will definitely fly back to Danang just to dine when you next change your menu : )",5,5,5,,,,2025-06-04,2025-10-04

2. The glutinous rice – so much umami, great texture with the mushrooms and scallops.

3 friends and I booked the 9-course full experience with alcohol pairing. For myself, only the eel and isopod dishes impressed me. The other dishes really did not perform well like the prawn is overcooked and other dishes were not inspiring.

For the alcohol pairing, they gave us a few sake and also some white wine and red wine. Again they did not taste good just like some random bottles you can find the supermarket. We further checked the bottles to the Internet and some of them were around USD25. The four of us are not experienced person in wine tasting and we were not saying that alcohol with low price tastes poor but wasn’t expecting something in the supermarket will be found in a fine dining restaurant.

Given that the food and beverages are not at their best, we would say the full dining experience is not poor with the stories behind each course and the explanation from Tony.

Cards are provided to us explaining the origin of the ingredients, where the ingredients come from and why are those ingredients are picked. Tony is the staff who served us and he did a very great job on explaining the full story of the 9 courses so that we can fully understand the journey of the dinner. Shoutout to Tony, he is very passionate and considerate person, elevates the whole dining experience to another level.

Overall it was not a 100% poor experience but definitely not a good one. We really appreciates the idea of making the whole dining as a journey. Yet, they are charging us around USD 109 for the 9 courses and USD 68 for the wine pairing.

Seat very comfortably, each table is well spaced; couldn’t hear any conversation from other tables. Have been to other French Michelin recommended restaurants in DaNang, those are really too packed and need to sit near to the main door. Full-Storey experience – all the first 7 courses were amazingly presented and delicious. Ingredients are very thoughtful. Each bite is presented with a note, with full description of the ingredient, method and background. You can eat while reading the card, definitely helps enhancing the overall experience. Personally I love the first sea urchin, Vietnamese Scallop, Y Tendon was a surprise (taste like chopped HK-style 牛筋腩, very elastic and juicy). The Giant isopod was what I was looking forward the whole night. My first time experiencing this seafood, amazingly delicious and definitely load of fun taking picture of the shell. The rice which came along with the beef, so creamy and in perfect texture. Though so full, we asked for refill.

I think the lacking was the dessert. The bottom layer of the jackfruit cake was quite dry, not a lot of flavour. The Longan honey ice-cream was refreshing, however there was a piece of yogurt/jelly at the bottom which was quite hard. I didn’t go for the wine pairing because most of them were sake. Unfortunately the wine menu was quite simple. Not a lot to choose from. I will give a 8.5/10 for Nen. I hope to revisit again later if there is a new menu.",5,4,5,,,,2025-06-04,2025-10-04

While a few dishes stood out and were genuinely well-executed, the overall experience fell short. Many items on the menu felt overly complicated, with too many ingredients and flavors that didn’t come together in a cohesive way. Some flavors were repeated across dishes, and certain components felt like they were added just for the sake of complexity rather than enhancing the dish. Instead of creating a symphony of bold, thoughtful flavors, it often felt muddled and disjointed.

We chose the Full Experience menu with 9 courses.

The first course was a trio of small dishes: sea urchin, mangosteen, and banana rhizome. The sea urchin, served with shrimp roe mousse, was phenomenal, easily one of the highlights of the meal. Unfortunately, the other two items in the trio fell flat. They lacked the same depth of flavor and, more importantly, didn’t feel connected to each other or to the overall theme. The dish felt more like three unrelated ideas on one plate rather than a thoughtfully composed start to the meal.

The second course was a scallop served with fermented coconut and pineapple. I really enjoyed the flavor and concept, but the acidity was a bit too sharp for my taste. A slight adjustment would have made the balance much more enjoyable.

The third dish featured eel fish and tofu. It was just okay, but certainly lacking the “wow” factor I was hoping for. One puzzling element was the addition of sweet potato crackers on top. They were bland and didn’t contribute anything to the flavor or texture of the dish, making them feel unnecessary.

Next came Y tendon and ambarella, which was my favorite dish of the evening. It was incredibly well-executed, with a flavor profile that stood out from the rest, complex, balanced, and memorable.

Unfortunately, the fifth and sixth courses started to blur together. Both dishes leaned heavily on creamy components and, while each had some merit, the repeated flavor profile made the experience feel monotonous. What’s more, they both included a long list of ingredients that didn’t seem to add much value. Instead of enhancing the dishes, the complexity felt forced, like the kitchen was trying to impress with volume rather than cohesion. It left me wondering why the flavors weren’t more thoughtfully restrained and focused.

The final savory course was pheasant with glutinous corn and it was a real miss. The pheasant had a strange taste that clashed with the soursop, creating a very unbalanced dish. The glutinous corn may have been an interesting texture element, but it wasn’t enough to save the dish. Alongside that, they served rice with clams, which was underwhelming and felt disconnected from the rest of the plate. Once again, the lack of cohesion across components made the dish feel confused and unfocused.

As for dessert, it was disappointing. These would be acceptable in a standard dessert café, but in the context of a fine dining tasting menu, they felt basic and uninspired. Honestly, if I were judging just on the dessert, I’d be asking for my money back.

Overall, my experience at Nen was underwhelming, especially given the high expectations set by their reputation for elevated Vietnamese cuisine. While there were a couple of standout moments, like the sea urchin dish and the Y tendon with ambarella, much of the meal felt disjointed, overly complicated, and lacking in cohesion. Several dishes included too many ingredients that didn’t add value, making the complexity feel forced rather than refined. Flavor repetition across courses made parts of the tasting menu feel monotonous, and the desserts fell far short of what you’d expect from a fine dining experience. For the price point and the ambition of the concept, the execution simply didn’t deliver.",4,2,4,,,,2025-06-04,2025-10-04

I was excited to try it again and see how it evolved, but unfortunately I came away very disappointed. Our meal on April 8 was one of the worst fine dining meals I've ever had.

The room is indeed gorgeous and the service was decent, though a bit forced to me. While the food looked the part, with the exception of the scallop and rice patty crab, it just didn't taste good. Throughout the meal, the dishes were tepid and seemed to have been sitting out before being served. Many lacked flavour.

The prawn was overcooked and tasted as if it had been on the counter for an hour. The eel and tofu ‘umami bomb’ was totally undermined by the giant slab of tasteless and too soft tofu. The isopod bisque was bland and watery, never mind the rubbery isopod itself. The corn, with ‘carefully piped’ puree was cold and sad. The cake dessert was burnt and completely unremarkable - you’d get something better at a random bakery. An ice cream dessert was refreshing, but it lacked any sort of flavour and was just watery ice cream.

The wine pairings were also a disappointment. While $80 is not a huge amount for a pairing these days, the pours were minuscule - I’d estimate in the region of half a bottle per person. We had to order beer on top of our pairing. Then, the wines themselves were not very interesting. Four of the eight glasses were sake, which is too many in one pairing and they were not an improvement over serving a wine.

The bill came to $200 per person, but we were given a 10% discount and a bottle of liquor to take away, ostensibly because there was a fly buzzing around at one point in the meal. I overheard them giving a discount to another table across the (near empty) room so I wonder whether the discount is a regular occurrence (for one reason or another).

This was quite simply a terrible meal. The food was bad and I can't help but feel a bit taken advantage of by the wine pairing. Avoid my mistake and go somewhere else.",3,1,2,,,,2025-06-04,2025-10-04

The ""Story Menu"" at Nén took us on a captivating culinary adventure.  Each dish was a work of art, beautifully presented and bursting with flavour:

Pumpkin Soup with Abalone: The creamy sweetness of the pumpkin soup was perfectly balanced by the delicate flavour of the abalone. The presentation, with the abalone shells artfully arranged around the soup, was visually stunning.
Tomato Soup with Crab: A vibrant and flavourful soup that showcased the freshness of the ingredients.
Compressed Watermelon with Tomato Consommé: The refreshing sweetness of the watermelon was beautifully enhanced by the savoury tomato consommé.
Da Nang Sky: Inspired by the Danang sky, this dessert was a light and refreshing end to the meal. The description card explained the dish's inspiration, adding a poetic touch to the experience.  The combination of textures and the subtle sweetness was a perfect finale.

They took excellent care of us and our children. I cannot thank the staff enough for their care of my children/family.  We frequent Michelin restaurants and this was on par!  The food was an excellent take on Vietnamese cuisine.  Most dishes contain shellfish so if you have allergies, you will likely need to choose vegan unless the menu changes. One person in our party did the vegan option and enjoyed every dish!  With a few more touches (focusing on textures, ease of consumption, timing, and variety), this restaurant will surely earn its own Michelin star.  Price was on point for the service provided.

We started with a welcome drink, and they confirmed the course menu and drinks (thanks for their flexibility, even though we were late!).

We were then taken to a separate room for a presentation of the day's ingredients, highlighting their focus on local ingredients.
Each dish was accompanied by a hand-drawn explanation card, and the chef occasionally used Japanese to provide personalized explanations to maximize our enjoyment.
The pairings were a mix of wine and sake, and with each dish, I was worried I might get too drunk, but everything was so delicious that I ate it all up in no time! (lol)

The signature dishes for all three meals required the use of cilantro, and since my partner doesn't like it, they prepared something like beef tendon curry, which was also absolutely delicious.

The chef, who studied Japanese cuisine, prepares creative dishes, so you can pair them with Japanese sake. The dishes are very sophisticated and rich, but the flavors were a bit off. I enjoyed the jellyfish dish and understood the theme. The other dishes, while I understand the theme, would have tasted better if they had incorporated Japanese dashi broth. Indeed, Gaggan is a fusion of Indian, Japanese, and Thai cuisine, and I remember enjoying the flavors and textures more than the food itself.

I’m genuinely confused with the high reviews this place has gotten. It started off strong with the aperitif and the whole staff was just so sweet. However, everything progressively went downhill with every new dish we got. I enjoyed the drink pairing more than the food itself and that’s saying a lot because I usually don’t even like to drink. It felt as if the chef brought a bunch of ingredients together, displayed beautifully in small portions, paired it with a story and slapped a “Michelin selected” price tag on it. I hate to give this place a 1 star (which is rare for me) and especially since the staff is so nice, but I’d like to see them do better or maybe not charge an outrageous price for mediocre food.

This is exactly what makes me smile...

This is my second time visiting this store.
I can't forget the excitement I felt when I first came, and I will definitely come again!! ️, and I did what I said.

Not only am I happy to be here again, but even though last time was so moving, I think this time it will be even better. I was even more impressed.

First of all, the staff at the store remembered me from the last time I was there 😭
And just by looking at the accessories...
I was really happy 🍀

Each dish is carefully explained with illustrations written on paper.
Moreover, he immediately noticed that I was Japanese and even brought me a paper in Japanese🙏🏻

The taste is indescribable, and I can't convey my excitement until I actually taste it.

The aroma and taste of Da Nang's mysterious ingredients were carefully extracted, and I could feel the detailed work with my tongue.

It's so delicious I have no words 😭

I want everyone to experience this excitement.
I sincerely agree.

And the space is also wonderful.
I have never seen a restaurant with simple walls painted entirely in black.
The lighting is just right, the tables and chairs are made of wood, and even the napkins are carefully selected.

Even people who don't usually take photos will be tempted to press the camera shutter.

And finally,
I had my hair down, and the moment the store staff saw me trying to tie it up, they brought me a hair tie...
How much care do you give...

I was moved by every scene.

I don't want to touch on it too much, but there are people who are intentionally lowering the store's reputation with obvious throwaway accounts.
It's all a lie so don't believe it.
Harassment can happen anytime, anywhere, so it can't be helped.

I highly recommend this store to everyone.

I think it's worth coming to Da Nang just to visit this shop.

Thank you very much for the wonderful time 😊

The atmosphere is indeed something to behold, with a thoughtful renovation lending the space an air of elegance and style. The presentation of the dishes is immaculate, and the menu is a collection of well-designed names that promise a culinary adventure.

However, it is with a heavy heart that I must report that the substance of the meal did not live up to its stylish wrapping. The ambition to create a fancy and attractive setting seems to have overshadowed the most crucial aspect of a dining establishment – the food itself. Each dish, though visually appealing, was a gastronomic disappointment. The flavors were indistinct and monotonous, with none of the vibrancy or depth that one would expect from a restaurant of such purported caliber. The ingredients seemed to lose their individuality, merging into a singular, unremarkable taste with no layers or complexity to savor.

A restaurant's soul is its cuisine, and no amount of atmospheric charm or menu creativity can compensate for culinary execution that fails to deliver. I would urge the chef and the management at Nen Restaurant to realign their focus on the essence of their establishment: the food. Only then will the beautiful shell of the restaurant find its pearl.

It's strictly Vietnamese dining, and there are quite a few local flavors. The main dish, fan shrimp, was served in a 1/15th of the size, and the main dish, abalone, was served in the amount of abalone you'd find in convenience store abalone porridge. The duck dish had the tendons intact, so it wasn't cut or chewy. I told them it was too tough, so I followed the recipe and they said they'd cut it up for me if I needed it. Just eat whatever they give you, no one cares. The restaurant I paid 7.3 million dong for two didn't even pour me wine. I poured it all myself, like I was pouring soju. They showed me how to cook it, and then spilled wax on the table, scraping it off, causing a huge fuss. This restaurant is a great option for most restaurants in Da Nang. Don't be overly curious, and I highly recommend going somewhere else. It's Vietnamese cuisine presented beautifully, so it's a novel approach for locals, but for foreigners, it's tasteless. It's a Korean fusion restaurant, but it's not my style. It's like putting ketchup on a kimchi stew that's exactly the size of a restaurant. I'm a Korean resident, and if someone were to go there, I'd do my best to dissuade them. I couldn't understand why neither the manager nor the chef asked why they left so much food behind.

Service, atmosphere, presentation of dishes - 10/10 👏🏼 A very interesting experience! However, I have to take off one star because, having chosen the most expensive set of dishes, I couldn’t even eat some of the dishes. Some of the dishes were great! But, for example, one of the dishes was beef knee cartilage in sauce. I understand that everyone has their own taste, of course. But such a “masterpiece” is absolutely not for me. Or, for example, the duck. It looked delicious, I love duck, but I chewed it for a very long time, and still couldn’t chew it. We paid about 5 million for dinner. For the sake of new emotions and combinations of flavors - it’s definitely worth coming. But next time I would go to a similar place in Bangkok, for example.

No matter how advanced your cooking techniques are, the most original purpose of the dish is to be full and delicious, and you have completely failed.

Sommelier was the weak point.

The food was incredible honestly, every course had been spectacular and was so well thought. Even though in the beginning i wasn’t fond of everything i had read on the menu, everything i ate was brilliant !
In the end, they even gifted me their homemade chocolate as a little present and we took some nice polaroids.
The service was outstanding and very very attentive and they always checked on us i really loved the atmosphere. The restaurant is beautiful in general, a little bit dark but it suited the experience.

And best of all, the staff were very friendly and explained things carefully and slowly so that I, who can only understand broken English, could understand.

I didn't feel so reserved.
It's located in a back alley, so I had a hard time finding a taxi. Please show this Google Map to the driver!

To put it simply, I think NEN has good taste ^_^

The entrance and interior are also modern.

The food was very attentive and I got a mouthful of food in between the 5 dishes.

It was quite a volume.

The store staff greeted me with a smile, so it was easy to spend time there.

The price was 6000 yen including one bottle of white wine for three people.

Chef notes were provided as well, wonderfully written. I particularly enjoyed the poem for the dessert, which by the way was particularly spectacular as it looked like a stone but tasted nothing like one. ♥️ Service was really good.

I had both the eight course set while my wife had the five course set. There isn’t complete overlap between the two so I was able to try a lot of different dishes.  In between the courses you will also receive palate cleansers, an amuse bouche, and other small tastes. So be prepared to spend anywhere between 2- 2.5 hours for your meal.  The meal is really a good bargain at 893k and 1,380k for the five course and eight course respectively. I definitely would recommend coming here if you want to enjoy a nice meal while in Danang.

Food: 4.25 stars
Service/environment: 4.5 stars
Value: 4.5 stars
Overall: 4.25 stars

If you have the time I would go for the 8 course set. The courses aren’t more tapas portions and I would have not been full with the five course set (I eat a lot).

My favorites of the evening:

Bo Kuo (beef stew) - To me this was the best tasting dish of the evening. Extremely clean broth that reminds my a bit of Taiwanese beef noodles soup with the star anise and five spice flavor really prominent here.
Mi Quang - The noodle dish is a staple of Da nang. I’m no expert on Mi Quang but I did really enjoy this version. This had a nice balance between the brininess of the clams with the pesto noodles. It was also really fun mixing this dish together.
Cockle with fermented sea urchin noodles- I really enjoyed the grilled conch. It had a nice textural contrast to the softness of the noodles.  The noodles themselves tasted good but I wish I got more richness from the sea urchin. That luxurious creaminess from the sea urchin would have really made this great and would probably put this over the beef stew as my favorite.",,,,,,,2019-10-04,2025-10-04

Our first time in Nen restaurant was on the 17 Feb 2019. Prior to booking I requested a special occasion I didn’t accept the kind offer which cost extra for our special occasion, however I expect at least a greeting for our date but nothing happened. First step into the restaurant was cozy and quiet atmosphere. The guy with Blue shirt (seems like a  manager) greeting us informally by straight into the options of the menu without explaining and introduction.
We both selected the New Vietnamese menu as we appreciated the chefs effort but starting with 2 complimentary drinks that was to strong and has a burning taste that stuck to your through top with very salty apple skewers it ruined the palate and caused a very unpleasant amuse-bouche. Part 2 from the menu, the quail dish overall was too salty and the fried quail taste like KFC. Part 3, smoke braised fish dish was a failure to me because the rice was very dry like a hockey puck with a wilted spring onion and the fish and the sauce was very salty. The only best thing about this dish was the quail egg and the  homemade pickles. All palate cleanser was very wonderful. Finally we had ginger theme dessert dish. The ice cream has a very nice flavour but the texture was too icy not creamy. The tofu pudding was light in flavour but with a very wet cookie. Overall it was okay and not worth the value caused of mediocre service.",,,,,,,2019-10-04,2025-10-04

Although the food everywhere we ate was delicious, Nen was on a totally different level.  It was neat to end the trip there, after eating a lot of traditional Vietnamese food and getting a sense of the cuisine.  Nen offers two set menus (and an a la carte menu)--the ""Refined"" which is more classic dishes, and ""New"" which is the chef's more modern creations using traditional Vietnamese ingredients.  My husband got New and I got Refined so that we could taste both.  Both were fabulous.  I did the Refined with wine pairing and thought the pairings were excellent.  Everything was very, very well executed.  No overly strong flavors or strange textures as noted in other reviews.  The flavors were bold, presentation charming, and portion-size just right.  I don't even like dessert but this dessert was really food.  Chef came out at the end and actually sat at our table and chatted for a few minutes.  The dining room is very simple but lovely--all glass and surrounded by greenery in a quiet suburban neighborhood.  We've eaten at many 1, 2, and 3-Michelin starred restaurants all across the world, and as I told the chef at Nen, her food is worthy of at least a star and I hope she gets it someday.

Due to my rare allergy to fish, traveling in Vietnam is a real challenge.
But upon arrival we were informed the chef had prepared a complete multi course menu for me.
There is no other word but perfection to describe the food and service we were so privileged to experience that night.

We had both their new Vietnamese and refined Vietnamese menus.  The food here is both familiar and inventive, refined, but still keeping in touch with the rustic traditional roots.

Their variation on My Quang is delicious, with a sauce that is unctuous, and thicker than usual Mi Quang sauce.  The grilled beef in betel leaves is meltingly tender, and the peanut sauce that comes with it is so good, they could put it in a bowl and sell it on it's own as a meal.  Their wasabi infused fish is brilliant.  Their tongue with crispy fried spleen is unique, and delicious.

There are plenty of other great dishes, but the best thing I can say is you will find something to appreciate about each item in the menu, and it will broaden your palate and make you want to talk about what's on the plate in front of you.

Every dish balances the signature “mala” punch of spice and numbing heat with rich, savory depth.

✔️ Special Notes

A Vietnamese-Chinese style restaurant with a slightly casual atmosphere, a little different from the authentic Chinese restaurant.

I visited after hearing rumors of a ""good restaurant"" locally, and the interior was so comfortable that it felt the coolest among the restaurants I've visited so far.

There are about 10 tables for 4 people.
It was a 'perfect' atmosphere where I could focus on the scent and taste of the food.

1. TÔM MIẾN SỐT TỎI (VND 219,000)
Ingredients such as shrimp, glass noodles, cabbage, and enoki mushrooms
Tastes like a Korean earthenware pot with a lot of garlic? It was also quite tasty when mixed with the rice that came with it. This was my favorite of the 3 I ordered. Highly recommended!!

2. Cucumber Salad (VND 75,000)
Cucumber Salad
Sweet and refreshing dressing, peanut topping, and edible.

3. Sui Khao (VND 79,000)
Sui Khao is much more spicy than I expected!

My lips were tingling as soon as I ate it.. Highly recommended for those who like spicy food.

However, those who are sensitive to spices should be careful.

4. LARUE (VND 25,000)
Larue beer / Beer produced in Da Nang. Manufacturer: Heineken Vietnam.

5. TIGER (VND 30,000)
Tiger beer / Singaporean lager beer

✔️ Final evaluation (Overall)
➖ The meal is edible / *Okay for a meal*
However, there may be likes and dislikes.",3,3,3,,,Korean,2025-08-04,2025-10-04

But instead of simply taking my order, the staff member questioned me over and over: “Are you sure?”, “It’s a lot of food”, “How many friends are coming?”, and kept pressing despite me explaining that my partner was coming shortly.

She left without placing the order. When my partner arrived and confirmed the order again, she repeated that it was too much food. I was so frustrated I finally said, “Yes, I’m fat. What now?” only then did she stop and take the order.

It was completely unnecessary. I came in wanting to support this restaurant, and I even planned to recommend it on my food review YouTube channel. But after this experience, I honestly can’t recommend it or say I’d return.

*old review*

*AC & card payment available* Just WOW amazing, authentic Chinese food! We tried so many dishes and loved them all. Everything was full of flavour and cooked perfectly. Most dishes are quite spicy, so if you’re sensitive to heat, it’s worth asking for less spice when you order. Definitely a must-visit if you’re craving real Chinese cuisine! Definitely coming back soon! 🥰",1,4,1,,Lunch,,2025-07-04,2025-10-04

Air conditioning - There is one, but it's not very cool and it's a bit hot.

There were wet tissues on the table, so I asked first, and they looked a bit sheepish and said yes, so I thought it was free and used them, but they charged 3,000 won each. That was ridiculous. Haha. If you didn't understand properly, you shouldn't answer. It's not much, but it makes me feel bad.

The menu is huge - like, almost overwhelming in the best way possible - and everything we tried was spot on with the flavors.

What I really appreciated is that they actually listen when you ask for ""not too spicy."" So many places either ignore you or make it so mild it tastes like nothing, but these guys nail that sweet spot where you still get all those complex Sichuan flavors without your mouth being on fire.

The dumplings though - wow. Seriously some of the best I've had. They're clearly putting real care into making these, and it shows. Whatever they're doing with the seasoning across all their dishes just works. You can tell someone in that kitchen really knows what they're doing.

It's one of those places where you keep discovering new things to try each time you go back. Perfect for when you want authentic Sichuan food but don't want to gamble on whether it'll be too intense or not flavorful enough. They've got that balance figured out.

Definitely going back to work through more of that massive menu!",5,5,5,,Dinner,,2025-07-04,2025-10-04

While I was expecting authentic flavors or even a unique twist, the dishes lacked the zest and quality one would hope for in a dedicated Chinese eatery. Some dishes were overly salty, while others felt bland, as though they were missing key ingredients. It wasn’t terrible, but it also wasn’t memorable.

Atmosphere & Service

One of the most unsettling aspects of the experience was the staff. They seemed visibly unhappy, which created an awkward atmosphere. Throughout my meal, I couldn’t help but notice staff members staring at customers. While it’s common for attentive service to involve occasional check-ins, this went beyond that and felt intrusive. It made me and other diners visibly uncomfortable, detracting from the overall dining experience.

The dandan noodles served here are completely different from Korea, with a lot of layu and thin noodles. They are full of octagonal cinnamon, cloves, meatballs, and chopi peppers!!!!  It's five spice mara rayu.
It's really delicious. Above all, it is an oil, but it does not feel greasy at all when you drink it, and this is the clean, top-quality marara oil!!!!  Be sure to give it a try!!!

But it's quite spicy and spicy, so if you like malatang and really like layu, try it. If you don't like oil and don't like mala, don't try it. ~^^

Heavenly level Rayu!!!!!!  It really absorbed all the oil!!!

The mapo tofu, which was highly praised by some, did not suit my taste as the Chinese-style soybean paste was thicker than I expected, and the tofu was soft tofu, so it was very soft!!!
If you think of Korean food, I recommend it. It's a new flavor. It's not the best mapo tofu!!!

Most recommended shrimp dumplings ㅡㅡ

It's the worst ㅡㅡ.  ?

Oh, I'm not saying it wasn't delicious, but those were fried dumplings, so they came out a bit hard and the taste was ordinary, so I didn't like it.
Expectations were high! !!!
I recommend eating wontons, steamed dumplings, or water dumplings here rather than those! Especially the pork dumplings drizzled with rayu sauce!!!!

Really 90% Chinese customers! 10% foreigners
No Vietnamese at all

The store is very clean, the staff barely speaks English, and the air conditioning is great!  It's a bit pricey but well worth it.

A Sichuan restaurant you must try when you go to Da Nang!!!!

PS. Personally, it was the best Rayu and it had a shocking taste!  Daeun Da Nang’s one pick!  The most memorable dish in Da Nang!!!!",5,5,5,Dine in,Lunch,Korean,2024-10-04,2025-10-04

Firstly, the portion sizes are very small. The prices get you thinking this is one of those affordable spots but its not.
Secondly, funnily enough, the food looks spectacular but lacks the Szechuan spice. It definitely has heaps of the tingling sensation making it feel like you’re eating mint or a pepper. Even their chilli oil lacks spice. The food is on the oilier side. I know Chinese cuisine is supposed to be oily and being from pakistan, i can appreciate oily food. But this felt a little extra. Thirdly, the place has Ac as well as giant fans and the food runs cold very quickly.

I was delighted to find Ayi Bistro open after their Tet Lunar New Year holiday as I was looking forward to sampling Sichuan cuisine again.
I was initially disappointed on my first visit as a few dishes were not available due to the extended Tet holiday break but this was soon dispelled by the quality of the food.
The mapu tofu with a few dashes of Chingkiang vinegar soon had my lips tingling delightfully for the duration of the meal.
The spicy wonton dumplings were utterly delicious and the double cooked pork with peppers and cucumber salad set each other off to perfection.
I probably ate too much rice but simply couldn't resist once it had soaked up all the cooking sauces.

Fried drypot Shrimp is my favorite, it’s so fresh, crisp, tasty with different flavors all in once. (Sorry it’s not included in my photos.) Of course other dishes like the spicy fried dumplings and vegetables are delicious. The price is really good, even a bit low when you taking consideration of the taste. And the owner of the restaurant is just so kind and sweet, she provided a lot of travel tips around Da Nang and those tips are so helpful for us as tourists, making us feel so welcomed and grateful as international tourists to Da Dang.

If you are staying in Danang for a few days and seeking for some food apart from Vietnamese food, I would highly recommend taking a visit at this restaurant. As a native Chinese, I would say this restaurant is not only a good choice as Chinese cuisine in Da Dang, but also better than most of the Chinese restaurants back in the mainland of China, so please don’t miss it.

The atmosphere wasn't my favorit, due to too much white light and lack of decoration it looks more like a buffet/eatery than a restaurant.
I was surprised because a lot of reviewers mentioned the 'enthusiastic staff' but we did not meet them: the waitress was not enthusiastic at all, we had to wait 30 minutes for a rice while every other food was on the table because they were preparing some Grab orders.

The hope with this restaurant was that I would get my Mala fix but unfortunately I was slightly disappointed.

Ordered the misappropriated xiao long bao (the version here is not a soup dumpling but a dry filing dumpling) and felt the filling to aspire but not fulfill the idea. A bit more heat from a seasoned pan might have given the bun some crispness, otherwise it’s nothing to write home about.

The dry pot chicken was well presented but similarly lacked the full flavor profile and most annoyingly had smashed chicken (similar to Da Nang fare) instead of distinct pieces of chicken thus leaving you in a minefield of bones that wreak havoc on dental work.

Would probably not go the chicken route if I ever come back but given other options, I think I would rather head to a higher end diner of the same genre and not risk my teeth!

I do thank the staff for asking for feedback at the payment point. I hope they one day get to visit Sichuan and learn from the wonders of this amazing Chinese province.",,,,,,,2022-10-04,2025-10-04

As someone who lived in Chengdu for 6 years, I haven’t had any authentic sichuan cuisine for over 2 years. I came here with high expectations after reading the reviews and it didn’t disappoint. The mapo dofu was perfect and the spicy wontons were amazing. The dumplings and xiao long bao were also spot on.

This is the best sichuan cuisine I’ve had outside of Chengdu and Chongqing, even compared to other cities in China!

It's Chinese food, but it's different from Korean Chinese food.
It's slightly weaker than traditional Chinese food.
So it tasted just right to my taste.
If you ask for it to be done in traditional Chinese style, they will do it.
Two things were especially delicious.
Noodles and mapo tofu.
The noodles feel soggy, but if you eat them with soup,
It's just a taste that I'm craving.
The more you eat, the more delicious things come in.
Two bowls will be possible.
This is my first time trying mapo tofu.
Using very soft tofu, it melts in your mouth.
It breaks down gently and has a particularly spicy flavor.
It was very impressive.
If you like spicy food, slightly spicy.
You have to ask for it.
It would be even better if you order and eat cucumber salad together.
Shrimp dumpling dish is also good.
There is also a spicy stir-fried chicken dish, which is really spicy.
It definitely doesn't taste like Korean spicy chicken feet.
Because it is stir-fried with spicy peppers, dancho, sancho, etc.
When you eat it, you say “Wow!”
The chicken is cut into small pieces and fried before being stir-fried, so it is a bit hard and seems to go well with beer.

Since it's local, it's in Vietnamese, English, or Chinese.
You can order.",,,,,,Korean,2022-10-04,2025-10-04

Fried rice: Salty fried rice
Mapo tofu: It has a unique spicy flavor that is a bit different from the typical Mapo tofu at Chinese restaurants in Korea. It might not be too spicy for Koreans.

The delivery was super clean!!
Affordable price and satisfying taste.

I ordered Ma Ba Tofu, Mixed Hotpot and Cucumber Salad. The taste is quite good, you can adjust the spiciness.

Cheap compared to the general level, about 50-80k/dish. The 3 dishes above + 1 pot of jasmine tea cost about ~320k.

However, the atmosphere suffered from a lack of an outdoor space to escape the indoor noise of guests walking through to the beach side or the moving of tables setting up groups for dining.

While the staff were undeniably friendly, the service often felt disconnected. Despite their presence, we consistently had to flag someone down, as no one seemed dedicated to our table. This led to a significant wait for our food, and even some drinks being missed from our order, even during what started as a quiet period before becoming steady. Our Vietnamese friend's quick eye was essential, catching an error on the bill.

Despite these service hiccups, the lovely shuttle service back to the main gate offered a pleasant end to our visit.

- The view was amazing. It was a windy day so we had to sit inside.
- Their barista knows how to make a good mojito.

Cons
- We ordered seafood tower or whatever they called it. Unfortunately it was overcooked. Grilled prawns and lobsters were extremely dry. mussels and claims were mediocre.
- They forgot my drink when we moved to the other table

Upon arriving the staff picks you up with a small car and drives you to the restaurant. The restaurant looks very nice, the tables are very clean and you can see the sea depending on where you were sitting. Bathrooms were also very clean and well maintained. Our mocktails were nice also the size is very small, about 200ml.

Unfortunetely, that was all there is to say regarding the positive aspects.
The staff does not communicate well and is not well trained in English. We chose to apertisers and two main dishes. Out of our four choices, one apertiser and one main dish were not available, which is very sad considering the restaurant was empty.
The food wait time was about 20 minutes which is very good. My chicken was served cold. I asked and it is supposed to be like. It lacked seasoning and taste. My partner ordered noodles with spicy beef. The beef was raw. There was water poored over the noodles and beef and thats it. Also lacked taste. You have to consider that we paid almost 40 dollars in total which is a lot in Vietnam so our expectations were high but not met at all.

I just cannot recommend this restaurant and would advise you to look elsewhere",2,1,5,Dine in,Dinner,,2025-02-04,2025-10-04

After some significant effort booking a table we arrived for dinner.
Orders were taken promptly.
However once the food order was taken the staff were back twice to say certain items were no longer available.
Seems the kitchen and wait staff were not communicating making the decision for the order longer.
Food ordered was mostly average tasting even though it was well presented.
The atmosphere was rather dead even though outside they had a large party with karaoke and BBQ.
The staff never came back to offer dessert or further drinks

At 11pm nothing left to do but get the bill.

I had to change the reservations a couple times, but they were very responsive on the Google chat function.

We were a little worried when we got to the restaurant initially.  It's located in a resort, so you had to take a shuttle to the restaurant from the parking lot.  We walked in and no one else was in the restaurant (Thursday night).  Luckily we stuck with it and the food was finely prepared and delicious.  We had the rice noodle with seafood (fresh with chopped seafood), sweet and sour green mango and crispy flying fish (great flavors and textures),  stir-fried crab meat with vermicelli noodles (not a lot of crab, but had a tasty smoky flavor) and Nha Trang sturgeon marinated with galangal & tumeric (great sauce, topped with dill, and came with rice paper to wrap with some lettuce and vermicelli noodles).  Although it was more expensive than most restaurants in Da Nang, it's worth the ambience (and AC!) and well prepared meal. Unfortunately the sun had already set so we couldn't see the beach.

The setting is beautiful and elegant, the place is of a reasonable size and the atmosphere is even intimate (because it is not very busy in my opinion).
The staff present were very professional, attentive and pleasant (we would like to warmly thank Truong, our hostess who was more than perfect and gave very good advice).
We benefited from the special menu called buffet and were therefore able to taste almost all the dishes on the special menu. The chef even offered us a local specialty off the menu. My companion who was there mainly to accompany me loved everything.
They made the menu of the other hotel restaurant available for our children, which meant that everyone was satisfied.
Worthy of a high-end restaurant.

We went all in with the food (just check the photos!) — fresh sashimi, melt-in-your-mouth sushi, creative rolls, perfectly crisp fried dumplings, and steaming bowls of ramen so massive we had to share one. The flavors were spot-on, portions were generous, and every bite tasted fresh and well-prepared. We even enjoyed two smooth whiskey cocktails to top off the night.

And here’s the kicker — all of this came to under 750k! For the quality, quantity, and atmosphere, it’s an unbeatable deal in Da Nang. Whether you’re here for a casual dinner, a date night, or a special celebration, Ichiban Sushi delivers an experience that will have you planning your next visit before you’ve even left.

Don't think of the kind of sushi you eat in Korea. Even though I ordered it as a single item, the sushi smelled.

They took out the sashimi and used the fish for sushi, but all the sashimi had lost their color. (Tuna, salmon, sea urchin, etc.)
It was to the point where I wondered if it was even edible.

I used to work at a salmon sashimi restaurant, but this was the first time I'd seen something like this.
The person making sashimi didn't even know how to hold the rice properly, and he would grab the sushi and slurp it several times.

There was a reason there were no customers in the restaurant.

The staffs are friendly and polite, while the atmosphere and the ambience is just relaxing, fits for people who wants to have a meal in private like me. I ordered Gyoza (i forgot to take a picture of this), 2 sushi, a sashimi uni and a cup of orange juice, all for about less than 300k VND, which is really affordable. The sushi and sashimi are very fresh and delicious, while the Gyoza is a little crunchy on the bottom. Also another thing that i also like is that they put just enough wasabi for you to not feeling too much spicy, while also enough for you to taste the freshness of the fish.
I highly recommended this place. Definitely will comeback again in the future.

While searching just in case, I saw Ganesh restaurant and went to eat there!

Mangola is really the best! It doesn't even taste like water because it's made without ice.
It was thick~

Naan haha is really awesome..Korean naan comes in 3 sizes.

It had more spices than in Korea, so it was really delicious!

The food was outstanding, bursting with authentic Indian flavors that were both rich and satisfying. Each dish was meticulously prepared and wonderfully flavorful, showcasing the culinary expertise of the chefs.
The service at Ganesh was equally impressive. Our server was attentive, courteous, and ensured that our dining experience was enjoyable from start to finish. Their professionalism and friendly demeanor added a personal touch to our visit.
Even our 2-year-old child loved the food, which speaks volumes about the restaurant's ability to cater to diverse palates, including those of young children. It’s not every day that you find a place where both adults and children can enjoy their meals so thoroughly.

Overall, I highly recommend Indian Restaurant Ganesh Da Nang for anyone seeking delicious Indian cuisine in a welcoming environment. We look forward to returning and savoring more of their delightful dishes!",5,5,5,,,,2024-10-04,2025-10-04

The women who work here threw the menus on our table instead of laying then down carefully, and looked bothered the few times we talked to them. The women who work here also screamed and yelled when they talked to each other, making it very unplesant to sit there.

The food was unfortunately mediocre. We had the Kadai Paneer and it was not flavorful, it tasted rather bland. The paneer tasted too sweet to us. The naan bread was very nice.

I used to love this restaurant ever since it opened. It is now openly contemptuous and racist to non-Indian patrons.

The food is now average at best and totally lacks flavour and kick. Neither the manager nor the waiter could be bothered addressing my complaint that the food was tasteless. The waiter warmed it up - end of story. Regrettably, I will not be back.

If you're not Indian, you may wish to think twice before visiting. If you are Indian, the place is pretty good if you like bland food and racist company.

Because there are many Indians holidaying in Da Nang now, the Indian restaurants do not want non-Indian customers. Your wish is my command, Adieu.

----------

Previous update - Truly fabulous restaurant that cannot be faulted on its food. Now let's discuss the Indian diners... I accept that cultures are different and I've been to India several times. The problem here, and it's an enormous problem, is that the Indian diners and staff are out of control. Shocking manners, ridiculously loud and violent when intoxicated. I will only ever return for lunch. You've completely lost control of the behaviour in your restaurant. This isn't normal!!!",2,1,1,,,,2024-10-04,2025-10-04

The size is different from the naan found in regular Indian restaurants.
Almost twice the size.
I ordered 3 naan, thinking it was a regular size, but since it was a large size, they gave me a tip telling me to try 2 and order more ^^
I ordered both the lamb curry and the chicken curry at medium spiciness. While the chicken curry was a bit light, the lamb curry had a heavy and impactful taste.
I ate two slices in an instant and enjoyed them so much that I was sucking on them with my fingers.

We tried a lot of Indian Restaurants in the area in Da Nang and they were all so welcoming.. India is knowing for its hospitality and we couldn't believe how we were treated at this Ganesh Place. We couldn't eat here so can't rate the food as we weren't even allowed to sit. The restaurant had 2 big tables empty and a sweet local lady working there welcomed us and asked us to take the table, but while entering itself I saw the Indian Man waving at us Saying No Leave, Leave no place. The girl was also confused. He called her and asked her to make us go. She was also quite confused and said sorry politely and we left. He probably wanted to save the tables for a bigger group. You can ask your guest to wait or inform them the waiting time and I guess should leave it upto them to decide if they want to wait up or leave.

8282,ChZDSUhNMG9nS0VJQ0FnSUN4Mjhfc1hnEAE,67,ARTI RAJ,6 reviews,1.0,2 years ago,"First and foremost, thank you for your prompt response. During my recent visit to your restaurant, I was accompanied by four individuals, including two females (myself included) and three males. Considering the presence of CCTV cameras in your establishment, I kindly request you to review the footage. I am the individual who lodged a complaint regarding the presence of an insect in my mojito, although we did order approximately 8-9 other items from your menu.

Allow me to clarify that as adults, we possess the ability to discern between insects and lemon seeds, as the mojito contains lemons and mint leaves. It is possible that one of your staff members, perhaps due to inebriation, overlooked the presence of a lemon seed. However, your response leads me to question the level of professionalism and customer service they are being taught. I would like to bring to your attention that we were charged for the items we did not consume.

Rather than instructing your staff on proper customer treatment, it is disconcerting to observe that you referred to your patrons as ""cheap"" and advised against their travels. Similarly, I would like to extend the same suggestion to you; prioritize enhancing your communication skills before further engaging in the hospitality industry. Furthermore, I find it puzzling that you denied any knowledge of the belongings we left behind when we returned the following day. How can you assure the safety of such items if your staff claims they were not left behind? I personally witnessed the insect in my drink and insisted on examining the glass itself. However, the staff member presented two steel bowls and proceeded to separate the water and other components, which did not provide conclusive evidence of the insect's absence. Due to its small size, it could easily have become mixed with the contents, potentially originating from the mint leaves.

Regrettably, the situation escalated when the staff member became agitated and began shouting, resorting to derogatory comments, including referring to me as ""cheap."" I am uncertain as to the extent of your staff's inappropriate behavior and the threats made towards the females in our group. I find it alarming that they have not exceeded the boundaries of their misconduct, considering the behavior displayed thus far.

In light of these circumstances, I expect the owner of the establishment to exercise mindfulness and thoroughly investigate the entire situation before making decisions on resolving this issue. It appears that my initial expectations were set higher than the actual standards upheld by the owner. The unprofessional conduct of your inebriated staff members, who happened to be of Indian origin, has been disrespectful and intimidating, particularly towards the female members of our group. I question the severity of their actions and ponder whether they are capable of even more deplorable behavior.

Please provide a detailed response addressing the concerns I have raised, as I am eager to understand how you plan to rectify this matter and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.
Let me know as well how you are going to compensate for the toy car since you’re staff mentioned they don’t have the car and you mentioned it’s kept safely in your restaurant, that much safe that your staff could not return it to there owner.. and I am sure you are not cheap as you say about your customer…you will find a way to return it..and yeah we were tourists and cane back to our country.",,,,,,,2023-10-04,2025-10-04

Reached around 9.30 pm they were reluctant or rather refused to give Thali - that itself was indication they are not customer centric.
Food was below average - ordered chicken vindaloo - it was only full of aloo (potato). They don’t understand  vindaloo is more about preparation style and spices and not about aloo (potato)

The waitress who we'd told saw it and grabbed it with a tissue, not sure if she's brave or just accostumed. With that we couldn't eat the rest of our food so we asked for the pot of tea to take away. The manager apologised but I think they should have had a small detail with us as it ruined our dinner, just a small detail like inviting the tea or bread would have been nice. It's a pity, maybe we had bad luck, but it's the first time this has happened to us during our stay in Vietnam.

The meal started with the obligatory pappadums, chutneys and onions, all very nice. Then our mains arrived, WOW! Generous Portions of Curry, beautifully cooked Paratha with its layers of flaky whole-wheat goodness and a Naan to die for. The Ganesh Special with its egg on top was spiced perfectly, hot but not as hot as Vindaloo and the Chicken Madras was exceptional and just as spicy. Accompanied by the Chilli Garlic Naan these dishes were perfectly matched. The Paratha was good to have when you needed to calm the senses down in your mouth from the Chilli.
The staff were all very attentive and when I got the bill I was quietly surprised to see how small it was for such a big meal.

I have ordered from here not less than 20 times in the past 2 months. Producing excellent quality food... consistently. I order regularly from Ganesh, and they have no ""off/bad days"". Each and every dish is prepared freshly and is served glistening with freshness and packed with flavour according to individual needs. The Biriyani is particularly delightful, and the meat is cooked with the dish, hence incredible tenderness. Too many other restaurants would fry the meat and add it separately, which can be easily identified. Ganesh is hand down, the vest Indian restaurant in Danang, and my personal favourite all in all. They have survived the lockdown and the pandemic (many others haven't) exactly because they are popular and awesome. If you like Indian food, look no further.

What I really liked about the Bún Bò here is that it includes beef tongue—a great addition that makes the dish stand out! Also, the pork knuckle (giò heo) is pre-sliced, which makes it incredibly easy and convenient to eat.

For me personally, the overall flavor of the Bún Bò was just okay, but my Korean friend absolutely loved it.

In fact, she said it was the best Vietnamese dish she had eaten during her entire trip. Based on her reaction, this place is a huge hit for first-time visitors to Vietnam!

This was my very first trip to Da Nang, and I couldn’t have chosen a better introduction to the city than Bún Bò Bà Rơi.

From the moment the bowl landed on the table, I knew it was going to be special. The noodles are silky and springy, holding up beautifully in the rich, aromatic broth — a broth that’s both comforting and exciting, with just the right balance of spice and warmth. The toppings are generous: slices of tender beef, chewy tendon, crab meatballs, cubes of pig’s blood, and fresh scallions sprinkled on top. Every spoonful tells a story — of tradition, care, and authenticity.

The place has that bustling, down-to-earth Vietnamese vibe, packed with locals and travelers alike. I even noticed many Korean visitors, which says a lot — when a dish attracts food lovers across cultures, you know it’s the real deal.

And here’s the kicker: Bún Bò Bà Rơi is Michelin-recognized (2024 & 2025), and honestly, it deserves every bit of that honor.

If you’re looking for a taste of Vietnam that will linger in your memory long after you’ve left, this is the spot. For me, it wasn’t just lunch — it was the moment I fell in love with Da Nang.

👉 A must-visit for anyone setting foot in this city.",5,5,5,Dine in,Breakfast,,2025-09-13,2025-10-04

I wouldn't say the beef noodle soup here is traditional as it's sweet. I'm used to a more of a salty taste with a strong lemongrass aroma. The lemongrass is very faint. Also, cha cua (crab meatball), is not traditionally in beef noodle soup. I think if you're traveling to Vietnam and haven't had this dish, you'll be pleasantly surprised as it is good. If you been eating bun bo or bun bo hue your entire life, you will be disappointed with this Michelin Guide recommended restaurant. There are condiments to make the beef noodle soup less sweet. I added more fish sauce, pickled onions, serano peppers and carrots, dry crushed peppers, and ate the beef noodle soup with a fresh cayenne pepper to make it less sweet. I noticed a lot of restaurants are cooking their noodle soups with more sugar than before, this place is no exception. The bun bo was ""good"", but I wouldn't come here again. The sweetness from bone broth vs sugar is distinctive and I would rather make my own bun bo hue than eat here again. Again, it's not bad, it's just not my taste.",4,4,3,,,,2025-04-04,2025-10-04

The restaurant is designed to celebrate birthdays and anniversaries, with each table stocked with appropriate decorations for these occasions.

We ordered the set menu for two people and it was quite delicious. The dish is prepared in advance so it is served very quickly, but still retains good flavor and reasonable portions.

The building could use a little more care, but that shouldn't affect the guest's experience of dining here too much.

But I was quite disappointed with the food, in the set menu I ordered there was
- Ceasar salad: used green lo lo, not romain, I asked the staff and they insisted it was romain 🤦‍♀️ if they ran out of romain, they could have informed the customer, I would have been very okay with it, there was no way to swap concepts like that.
- Mushroom soup: the dish was cold, the taste was bland
- Beef steak: cold beef, salty and cold pepper sauce so it was very thick
The restaurant space is very cozy and romantic, but the food experience was quite bad, lacking professionalism, I will not come back.",2,2,5,Dine in,,Vietnamese,2025-03-05,2025-10-05

Most dishes: sold out (by more than 4 different choices of dishes and wine too), only usual ones left
Red Wine: cold, directly out of the fridge
Soft Drinks: (coke + water) warm, haven't seen any fridge from a distance...

You're having a beautiful location and could be a hidden gem for having a nice romantic location for dinner-dates and more... but you need urgently to improve your skills. And please, very important: serve Softdrinks cold, not the Red wine 😉",2,2,4,Dine in,Dinner,,2025-03-05,2025-10-05

However, tonight, when I came to this bistro, I couldn't help but feel like I was falling in love with someone who had a charming appearance but lacked sincerity, and in the end there was only disappointment. The restaurant space is really beautiful, cozy and comfortable. The dim light and bustling holiday atmosphere made me feel sorry for the fact that this place was crowded. The drinks are well prepared, really fresh and relieve the tense atmosphere of the evening. However, those were the only things that could be praised. Dinner began with a strange emptiness: the appetizers were filled with nothing but anticipation. Next is Asian soup, but it can't be called soup. That thin, fishy broth made me want to forget it immediately. If love were a dish, it would certainly be like this, beautiful but lacking a rich feeling. The next Caesar salad lacks the fatty, salty, slightly sour taste of caecar sauce, a small but necessary detail for the dish to have its soul. Instead, it was simply neatly arranged vegetable leaves, but lacking a decisive flavor, just like a love affair lacking real emotions, leaving only pretense. And then the main dish: cold beef steak. Not cold in the usual sense, but cold from start to finish, as if it had been long forgotten in the kitchen. Side dishes are just ""thrown on the table for show"", without any sophistication. The accompanying sauce was thick, like an unsuccessful attempt to try to make the meal seem appetizing, but it made the dish even more heavy and difficult to eat. The spaghetti was no better, cold and sticky, the pasta sauce was sparse and dimpled, more like Quang noodles than a standard spaghetti dish. A complete failure in terms of taste and sophistication, like a love affair that doesn't put enough effort into sublimation, only remaining stagnant. Finally, tiiramisu, the dessert that I hoped would save the dinner. But no, it was frozen in the middle, making this dish no different from cold love, unable to ignite any emotions. I left the restaurant with a clear lesson: a beautiful space cannot save a bad experience, just as a perfect appearance cannot hide an inside full of irreparable things. A dinner where every dish was stuck in a state of indifference, not too bad to skip, but not good enough to be memorable either. And in relationships like that, there is only one outcome: there will never be a second time.",2,1,5,,,Vietnamese,2025-03-05,2025-10-05

They said “the restaurant is so busy with reservations” as an explanation - could’ve just told us at the beginning that they could serve us in a timely manner. The steak was so chewy and the lamb was the driest thing we’ve had. For the price at 400k/plate, this place only has the aesthetic going for it. The place is cute and geared towards couples, but don’t go if you want actual good food.

I’m not a big fan of the reviews but after giving it 3 chances during the last year my experience was that bad that I couldn’t let it go.
Last time I went, the service wasn’t even capable to understand that my colleague was intolerant to dairy food. After 10 minutes of trying to change the mashed potatoes for french fries they just decided to not bring anything. 300K for a chicken leg that was cooked 3 days ago. My pasta was basically ketchup with bell peppers, for 250K. Not even in the cheapest places I ate such a bad pasta.

The appetizer is a piece of cake that is too small.
The next dish is pumpkin soup, eaten like baby food, bland.
Next is salad, the vegetables are not processed to achieve a cool, crispy texture. No sauce so it is very bland.
Spaghetti with king prawns. The prawns are left with their heads and do not look good. The sauce is too thin and bland to recognize the ingredients of the sauce. The decoration looks confusing on a plate that is too big.
The beef steak is too tough, the staff does not ask how cooked you want it, the baked potatoes do not have the usual aroma. The beef sauce is also bland and does not highlight the flavor. The decoration is also on a plate that is too big, the European dish has a bowl of sauce that looks like a wine cup.
The tiramisu cake is okay with a hint of coconut and wine. But 2 people only got 1 tiny cake for dessert. Disappointed and will not come back again",,,,Dine in,Dinner,Vietnamese,2023-10-05,2025-10-05

While exploring Da Nang, I decided to eat after being warmly approached by my Azerbaijani friend who had just started working there. The Adana kebab was mediocre, and the portion was small. The tzatziki was served warm. However, when I asked for the bill, I was disappointed to be charged 25k VND for the tea. The tea was also cold and extremely stale. This might be acceptable if restaurant prices were more reasonable, but that's not the case. You can eat on side streets in central Vietnam for 30k and enjoy unlimited Vietnamese tea.

He's simple, genuine, and passionate about his work. It's hard to find people like him.

I was truly surprised and delighted to encounter such high-quality Turkish cuisine in Vietnam, especially in such a remote region. Both the presentation and the taste exceeded my expectations.
The restaurant's atmosphere is also very pleasant, warm, and clean. It's a popular choice for both locals and tourists.

Those familiar with Turkish cuisine can pretty much guess what to expect, but for those unfamiliar with it, it's a wonderful discovery. I highly recommend trying Chef Nejat's dishes. Great job!

The entree could not be explained by the wait staff so I decided to just have a main despite being quite hungry.
The chicken dish came out which was mostly bread with tiny portions of chicken. It might have been ok if the bread was fresh. It had the texture of two day old bread. I ate half and decided to give up. I paid the bill. The worst 205,000vnd I have ever spent.

I tried this restaurant, but it was the worst Turkish food I ever had in my life. I know Turkish food very well, and this was not it.

**The only good thing:**
- The staff were nice and friendly

**The bad things:**
- **Falafel:** Looked like meatballs, not like real falafel. Tasted bad.
- **Lamb platter:** Very little meat, mostly bread. Meat tasted old, like it was heated in a microwave. No flavor.
- **Pita (Turkish bread):** Not fresh. Tasted like reheated dough.  Not a Turkish pita bread from the grill.
- **Sauces:** No taste at all.

I didn’t finish my food, but nobody asked me why ? I think they knew.
This is not real Turkish food. The name says ""Sultan Istanbul,"" but the food is not Turkish. The chef is Vietnamese, not Turkish.  A waste of your money.

In a city like Da Nang with so much good food, this was a big disappointment. I not often write bad reviews, but this place wasted my money.

1. I explicitly stated that the food was poor ""meh.""
2. As you'll see from my other reviews, I tend to stay in 5* hotels. Affordability is never a concern. Only an idiot would repeatedly patronise an establishment offering poor value for money - similar to your own situation.

In summary, you're the highest priced Indian restaurant in Da Nang but your food, service, and comfort are all at the low end of the scale.

Why exactly do you levy a Service Charge? The service is dreadful. You should seriously consider switching to a roadside stall, mate

ORIGINAL REVIEW...

Yet another awful Indian restaurant in An Thuong. Food was meh and ridiculously expensive. Service was uber slow. The kicker was the service charge plus tax for this woefully underpar experience.

You won't last long, buddy unless you change your ways. Regardless, I'm done. Enjoy the service charge.",1,2,1,,,,2024-10-05,2025-10-05

To start, their signature dish, the butter chicken, was unfortunately disappointing due to the inedible quality of the chicken. My wife and I were unable to finish it, which was quite surprising for a fine dining establishment.

On a brighter note, the eggplant and potato curry was decent, although the cheese naan did not live up to our expectations given its premium price of 150,000 VND. For that price, we expected something more exceptional.

My wife went to the toilet on the second floor, where she washed her hands with soap. When I went I found only a closed door on the second floor, so I went to the third floor, where there is a room with a toilet next to the kitchen. However, there was no soap to wash my hands in the toilet next to the kitchen. I can't emphasise enough the kind of thoughts that a customer can have about the toilet nearest to the kitchen, where food is being prepared, lacking soap. This is something that needs immediate remediation

Another area that could use improvement is the clarity of pricing. The 10% VAT is billed separately, meaning a 100,000 VND dish will actually cost 110,000 VND. In addition, there's a 5% service charge added to the bill. Incorporating these charges into the menu prices would make things simpler and more transparent for customers, without the need for separate calculations.

In summary, I'm giving this restaurant 3 stars, as the overall experience was a mixed bag. While the service was commendable, the food and pricing could use some refinement. I hope the management takes these points into consideration for the benefit of future diners.",4,2,3,,,,2023-10-05,2025-10-05

This spot brings the legendary chả cá Lã Vọng from Hanoi all the way to the Central coast—and they do it justice.

The moment you walk in, the place gives off a cozy, family-style vibe. Service is fast, friendly, and efficient. The staff takes time to explain the traditional way to enjoy the dish, which is part of the experience itself.

The star of the show is, of course, the chả cá—turmeric-marinated fish sizzling on a hot pan, cooked right at your table with fresh dill and green onions. It’s served with cold vermicelli noodles, roasted peanuts, fresh herbs, and a rich fermented shrimp paste (mắm tôm) or fish sauce if you’re not as adventurous. The fish is tender, flavorful, and beautifully balanced with the herbs and condiments.

They also offer a variety of Northern-style sides and beverages that complement the meal well.

💬 Highlights:
– Authentic flavor, just like in Hanoi
– Fresh ingredients and generous portions
– Great for small groups or a casual dinner

📍 Conveniently located and easy to find, it’s a perfect stop after a day exploring the city.

If you’re craving something different from the typical Central Vietnamese cuisine, Chả Cá Hà Nội Ngư Phố is a delicious detour worth taking. Highly recommended for foodies and anyone wanting a true taste of Hanoi in Da Nang.",5,5,5,,Dinner,,2025-08-05,2025-10-05

Okay food. Bad service. Staff isn't well trained, this might be the fault of management. There were no arrangements in the service, everything is chaotic. Food came slow. Drink even slower. Some tables order after us got served before us. And this is during noon of a Wednesday, not even dinner, not even weekend.

P/S.1: I add this part because of your response was incorrectly reflect the situation, hence, I will substract 1 star from the original review.
Your restaurant only had 2 staff to take care the whole floor, which is NOT dedicated to my only table. They worked in a frantic way, running all over the place.
Your staff brought the beginning dishes to our table after the other arriving later tables.
Your staff nearly forgot our drinks, only brought the drinks to our table after being reminded (almost immediately after we reminded, which got me thinking why we waited for so long for the drink when they was brought right after we complained).
When bringing the drink to the table, your staff didn't bring the full drink amount we ordered but forgot some.
We ordered extra condiments, which never came.
Your reply showed clearly how lack of professionalism and lack of responsibility right from the Management level for admitting the fault in service, so I highly doubt that you would change in the future.

But this is the first time I am very disappointed with the SERVICE ATTITUDE of the female staff today who brought the bill to pay for my table (upstairs, I paid at around 9pm).
I don't know who forced her to go to work so that she had to SHOW AN ATTITUDE to the CUSTOMER when I had not touched her. The owner can check the camera to verify, I am so disappointed.
1. When giving the bill, you had no POLITE at all when you shoved the bill in the customer's face like that (I only asked for politeness, not respect).
2. When my friend said to transfer money, you didn't even say ""ac transfer to this code/ or something like that"" but swiped the lighter straight and continued to show the code to the customer, without saying anything and showing a very contemptuous attitude. Of course, from this moment on, I was visibly upset, because my bill included services that I DESERVED to receive.

3. And when you saw that I was upset with you, after we paid the bill, you left but still deliberately turned back to glare at me. Is this the attitude I should accept?
Not to mention that I wanted to ignore the fact that the staff served the food and joked around from the beginning, but at least when standing in front of customers, the male employee acted very seriously.
I hope the restaurant improves this issue.",1,5,5,Dine in,Dinner,Vietnamese,2025-01-05,2025-10-05

Will not return

I have chosen to edit this review as the response of the owner is trying to blame “mắm tôm” for the reason that I found this experience disappointing. This is both a very ignorant and impolite way to address negative feedback from a paying customer. You’re making an assumption that this review is based on the fact that I am a foreigner, therefore in your mind that must be the reason I didn’t like the food.

Let me elaborate.

I have lived in Vietnam for around 14-15 years, spending around a decade living in Hanoi.

Chả cá lã vọng is one of my favourite dishes and finding this place was really quite exciting for me.

The staff were very unprofessional and non attentive, upon paying my bill I found the girl wearing the red Áo Dài exceptionally impolite. I asked to pay with a QR code and was pointed to go to the counter. Sure.

She proceeded to shout at another employee across the restaurant right next to my ear.

The music is a terrible collection of what one would find if you were put on hold while trying to call a bank.

Prices, definitely not cheap, but what I would consider fair considering the overall feel of the restaurant.

The food, terrible. Absolutely no flavour at all and nothing like you would experience in a place specialising in this in Hà Nội.

Portions are quite small, and the quality of the fish is sub standard. It didn’t taste fresh at all.

The problems lie with the staff, their attitude and with the quality of the food that is being served.

This place has potential but I stand by my original review.

If you want decent food, go somewhere else. This attempt at Chả Cá is very disappointing.

The restaurant is nice, but the food and the service is below standard.",1,1,1,Dine in,Lunch,,2024-10-05,2025-10-05

I stopped in front of the restaurant and saw only this guy. I only asked one question, which was probably the minimum politeness: Sir, is the restaurant still open? (Because I thought I was a bit late and even looking inside, I could still see tables eating). This guy stared at me without saying anything, slowly turned around and opened the door without saying a word. I stood there for 15 seconds, watching this guy's figure and saw him talking about something with the other employees. Another 15 seconds for me to figure out what the hell was going on and this guy was still acting like he had never seen me before. And so I turned away with 1000 questions. This person probably thinks that this city is the only place that sells Cha Ca La Vong so they don't need to serve customers, or this person is a relative of the owner, or this person has some kind of communication problem or... Last time I ate there was a fly in the shrimp, I thought I should just ignore it because the rate of 1 out of 4 times eating there was a fly in the fish sauce is acceptable.

It's grilled fish dish, served with shrimp paste, chili peppers, fragrant herbs, roasted peanuts, and rice noodles. I loved it so much it surpassed my two long-standing favorites, pho and banh mi.

Fast forward to this month, during my trip to Da Nang, I wondered if I could find a place that serves this dish. My search led me to Ngu Pho. Their rendition of cha ca was not only authentic but also incredibly satisfying. For this dish, I paid VND 155,000 ($6.51).

Here are a few things to note about Ngu Pho:

* They offer free WiFi
* Unfortunately, there's no complimentary drinking water
* The staff takes care of cooking the cha ca for you
* Note that using the hand towel provided at your table will be added to your bill.

Overall, Ngu Pho exceeded my expectations and brought back cherished memories of Hanoi's culinary delights. If you're in Da Nang and craving an authentic cha ca experience, this is the place to be.",5,5,4,,,,2023-10-05,2025-10-05

The first impression is probably that the restaurant is located on the front side of Tran Phu street and is easy to find. The second plus point is that the space is airy and clean. However, the air conditioner was a bit hot the day I went so I felt a bit uncomfortable eating. I ordered 3 of the shop's most signature dishes: 1 set of spring rolls + sweet and sour mixed lentils + braised lentils with banana and beans. Personally, I find sweet and sour mixed lentils to be okay, the fish is quite fresh but the sauce mixed with the salad is a bit bland. Braised lentils with banana and beans is the best for me. The braised fish is chewy and chewy and delicious when eaten with a piece of banana. As for the La Vong fish cake set, I think it's normal, a bit greasy, and not very suitable for the price.

The space is new, so the restaurant has just opened. However, the quality of the fish cakes and shrimp paste is average, not really as good as the ones in Hanoi. The banana and bean catfish dish is not really flavorful. The restaurant has a card reader, but it only accepts credit cards, my friend couldn't use an ATM card (because the machine doesn't read chips). The restaurant arranges the seats close together, so the space is cramped and noisy.",,,,,,Vietnamese,2022-10-05,2025-10-05

Hanoi traditional grill fish was amazing and goes very well with their special shrimp paste.
The shrimp paste taste better with lime and chili slices.
The staffs were very helpful and the menu had English so it was ok.
They have bigger space upstairs for groups as well.
The owner Mr. BIN is from Hanoi and he is very nice and professional.

The shop is clean and polite. Just leave your car on Tran Phu street.

Average price 119k/portion. 730k for 4 adults to eat and drink is also reasonable for a delicious lunch.
The quality of the dish is good, full of spices. In Da Nang, it is easy for everyone to eat, but requiring strict taste standards is a bit difficult.

The space is beautiful but eating doesn't feel comfortable. The area is not large and has a lot of furniture, so it feels stuffy.
The fish dish is very delicious, fatty, soft and naturally fragrant, but the fish pot is filled with a lot of cooking oil. The marinated fish itself has fatty oil, plus the addition of dill and green onion pan oil makes the fish more greasy. The shrimp paste was too sweet and had a lot of MSG. I really didn't feel the taste of the shrimp paste, only the MSG, and the sugar, even though I squeezed 2 lemons, couldn't cover up the sweetness.

My Order:

- Feedback:
- It was Chicken on the bone and not breast.
- Unfortunately there was more bone and gristle than meat.
- It wasn’t spicy as requested & had too much salt.
- The portion size was very small
- Not worth 145K (Very Disappointing)
- Rating: 1/5

- 1 x Garlic Naan with Chilli:
- Feedback:
- The naan was cooked well, but it was a little too oily for me
- Like the Vindaloo, there was no chilli

They adapted the spiciness to our taste, a couple of evenings we had spicier dishes, another evening i asked for less spicy, but my food was still very flavourful and tasty.

The waiting staff are always smiling, in a hurry to serve you and apologetic if service takes longer than expected. The 2 ladies who speak better English are brilliant! We very much noticed this every evening, as the restaurant is quite popular and it gets quite busy. These ladies were always very professional, calm and friendly, despite some customers being very demanding, at times rude and causing a huge commotion when they arrived in big groups, impatient, always asking for various things left and right, no please and not a thank you!

I gave 3 stars for the atmosphere, but this is only due to some noisy and impolite customers, nothing to do with the restaurant, or its staff!",5,5,3,Dine in,Dinner,,2025-02-05,2025-10-05

The service was good, two Vietnamese young girls serving and what looks to be the boss sat in the corner of the restaurant.

Whilst eating the curry the food was nice, no questions asked very good.

Unfortunately later that night throughout the whole night I felt ill, nausea and diarrhoea. I was rough I spent the last two days in bed with no energy. I can only blame the food I had that evening and I’m so disappointed. I was nearly in hospital this afternoon but I seeked medical advice from a local chemist, they examined me and I was diagnosed with food poisoning, dehydrated and energy was so weak I was advised go back to the hotel to rest.

Just make sure the cleanliness of these places is ok, the front might look good but the back kitchen might not be.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is pleasant, the building is very beautiful and authentic. However, when the waiter, who had just woken up, came and we asked him what food we could order, we were told that there was not much on the menu. I am allergic to onions and I asked him to indicate which of these dishes could be prepared without onions. He pointed his finger at everything with onions, except potatoes. We asked the kitchen if something more like breakfast could be made without onions, to which we received a negative answer.

A Must-Try Halal Gem in Danang!

Maxim Halal Restaurant is an absolute delight for anyone seeking delicious halal food in Danang. From the moment we walked in, the welcoming atmosphere and friendly service made us feel right at home.

The food is exceptional! The lentil soup is a must-try—comforting, flavorful, and absolutely perfect. The shawarma is hands down one of the best I’ve ever had—juicy, well-seasoned, and paired with fresh sides. Every dish we tried was outstanding, from the appetizers to the main courses.

The restaurant is clean, family-friendly, and offers a wide variety of options that cater to all tastes. Whether you’re craving Middle Eastern cuisine or simply looking for high-quality halal food, this place has it all.

Highly recommend Maxim Halal Restaurant for anyone visiting Danang. A perfect spot for both locals and tourists! Will definitely return!

Service was EXTREMELY poor. We had to setup our tables ourselves, were not given the drinks menu and had to ask for an extra plate several times. The waiters did not seem to care about the food or serving us properly. After waiting for a long time we got food that was very sub-par. The salad had a very rancid smell to it and we returned most of it. Meat was very chewy and not tasteful at all.

I have eaten Roast chicken , Beef Kebabs salad & Kabsa Rice at the Hoi An branch and have been following this store on social media .

Mubarak ( congrats ) on the new store . May Allah ( God ) bless your business with Barakah ( blessing) . Ameen

My hubby Ordered a minute before closing . The bread was unavailable . Owner communicated with my hubby .
My hubby asked him to make up what he  has and sent it .
Wow it was supper yummy , flavourful , beef cooked to perfection and perfect balance was everything. Condiments and chips accompanied this beef burger . I highly recommend both the Hoi An and Danang store. It’s seldom that restaurants receive my compliments . Please do visit if you want to enjoy the ambience . Beautifully decorated stores . Or order on Grab . Super easy and food came well packaged . No pics because we were very hungry .

I ate chicken with garlic sauce and spicy sauce, both were ok, but the spicy sauce was not spicy, I asked again and the kitchen changed the chicken wings with a spicier sauce but still not spicy, if you ask for more spicy, I think it will be saltier but not spicy. There are 2 things I don't like, 1 is the dining table is quite small, it's more comfortable for 2 people, because the table is small and because the restaurant takes care, they often clear away leftovers so it's okay. 2 is the panchan (pickled food) I ate for free everywhere and the panchan at other restaurants is much more diverse than at Bonchon, this is the first time charging so I was surprised even though the extra charge of 19k is not too expensive but it doesn't feel like it while the panchan is very easy to make and I didn't think I would have to charge for the smallest dish like that. Overall, I think the experience is okay so I rate it 4 stars. The bowl of panchan I took a picture of separately was an additional 19k order. There were 4 of us and I heard it was only 1 price.

The restaurant is located right in the center, so it's very close to eat. The staff is friendly and enthusiastic, 10 points for service 🥰

However, I find the restaurant's menu too difficult to see, difficult to read, and difficult to choose dishes. Because I often eat here, I order by instinct because I can't find the dish I want to order when looking at the menu 😌😌 I hope the restaurant can fix the menu to make it easier to choose dishes ^^

I really like the mala sauce chicken at the restaurant, it's so delicious that it's hard to describe. I'm also a fan of the chicken cartilage dish, only 69k, quite delicious compared to the price range ^^",,,,,Dinner,Vietnamese,2024-10-05,2025-10-05

But the chicken here is really delicious. The crispy skin does not separate when bitten, the seasoning is rich (a bit salty if you like it bland), the meat inside is not too mushy. Although it is a delivery, it is always hot, and they even put enough tissues and side dishes for me. When I have a chance, I will try other dishes besides chicken. 
Update 1: Today I went to eat directly at the store, the food is still delicious. However, the restaurant is a bit empty, maybe because the customer service is not good yet
Update 2: The Cheese Pasta dish is fatty and fragrant, the taste is a bit bland, so it is suitable for people who like Western-style spices. Mala sauce chicken is not for me at all, the spiciness is not too spicy but the salty and sweet parts are not evenly distributed",,,,,,Vietnamese,2024-10-05,2025-10-05

🏠 The restaurant space is clean and bright, designed in the style of ordering and paying first, then serving food. The restaurant does not serve fast food, and there are still staff to serve at the table. 
🍗 I ordered a portion of Combo Chicken M (including 4 chicken wings and 2 chicken thighs + mixed salad + 1 glass of water, in addition to a small bowl of papaya, white cabbage, and pickled carrots to eat with), with this combo I chose 2 types of sauce: Spicy Sauce and Garlic Sauce. The general comment is that the skin is crispy, both flavors are delicious but quite sweet. The sweet taste is suitable for children but the elderly will not like it and eating too much will make them feel sick. 
💰 Such a combo is 149k, acceptable for the quality of food, service and space of the restaurant. 
🍽️ There is also a small bucket on the table to put chicken bones to help keep the dining table clean. However, the arrangement of knives, plates, spoons and paper towels on the same horizontal wooden tray is considered unreasonable, making it quite difficult to get knives and plates (if using a vertical wooden box and dividing it into 3 compartments, it would be more convenient).

the grilled meat vermicelli was very tough, it was very tiring to chew
the spring rolls were all flour, heavy and disgusting
in general, every dish was a total failure.

The staff on the most recent visit served the food faster than the other times, but I found the staff a bit indifferent. Regarding the food, there were some dishes that I found okay. Some dishes tasted too normal, almost bland, not leaving any impression after finishing the meal. The worst dish that my whole family has ever tried here is the Sichuan Tofu Rice. Although it is a vegetarian dish inspired by Sichuan Ma Po Tofu, the dish did not taste any spicy. The smell and flavor of the dish were both strong with turmeric powder and five-spice powder. These two flavors completely overpowered the other flavors in the rice dish. Overall, I found the quality of the food to be getting worse and worse. Since it is a restaurant, I have no opinion on whether the price is expensive or cheap.

Ordered wet rice noodles but the staff brought out rice noodles, asked and was confused and said to call the manager. When it was finished, they said everything from the beginning, even dragging the manager out just to deal with a small problem. 

2. The food was too expensive compared to the quality, ordered 3 dishes and all of them were bad, I don't understand pho with bean sprouts, coriander and a few pieces of sausage but charged 100k. Because Sangha closed, this price made Sangha run away. 

3. The price was high but the restaurant was hot, cramped, couldn't turn on the air conditioner even though the customers were sitting close together. 

4. If the table didn't have chopsticks and spoons, the staff had to bring them out themselves, not wait to be reminded, when reminded, the chopsticks and spoons were wet as if they had just been washed.

The culinary offerings at ANs are bursting with bold flavours. My bowl of dried noodles resembled a symphony of enticing tastes, thanks to the inclusion of shiitake mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, wood ear mushrooms, tofu skin, and vegan spring rolls. However, it was the vegan spring rolls that truly left a lasting impression. The deep-fried rolls were irresistibly hot and crispy, boasting an amazing blend of nutty taro and the natural sweetness of sweet potato.

Notably, the restaurant is equipped with air conditioning, creating a comfortable environment. While the decor may be somewhat extravagant, the overall space exudes a cosy atmosphere.

My partner had a Thai curry that didn’t have the slightest resemblance with any sort of curry. Prices are VERY high compared to any veg restaurants - even the ones that are actually nice.

Delicious food!
I stopped by the restaurant for breakfast so I ordered crab noodle soup, it was delicious!
Fresh and clean vegetables! Delicious broth.
Diverse menu, from 35k and up.
Cute space, friendly staff.
Card payment available.
Suitable for large groups, fun ^^

The restaurant should pay attention!
I stopped by the restaurant, sat and waited for about 5 minutes for the food to be served. During that time, the restaurant can offer customers a cup of hot tea while waiting for the food to be served.
While I was 😋😋😋, the staff at the counter ran out to scan the kbyt code.
You can wait for me to finish 😋, scan the code when paying. Or while I'm waiting for the food to be served, about 3 minutes, you can come and scan the code, it's better!
Because when I'm 😋, I don't like being bothered 😂😂😂
Thank you for listening!

The restaurant is vegetarian but the price is not less than other meat restaurants. 3-4 people need 250k-450k. So when buying drinks, there are only ""Plastic"" cups, the price is not reasonable. 
Although the sidewalk restaurant is very small, it is very difficult to park, but the parking attendants are very enthusiastic. The staff in the restaurant are not good. I waited for more than 45 minutes, reminded 3 times but there was still a shortage of food for my table. Once, the staff mistakenly paid for my table with another table and just told me to go to the counter to pay. But neither of them knew ""SORRY"". 
I know the restaurant is very crowded on vegetarian days, but the attitude of the staff is not acceptable. Solve all the people eating at the restaurant before selling to the shipper.",,,,,,Vietnamese,2021-10-05,2025-10-05

The menu isn’t fancy—pork, eggs, morning glory, a few sides—but what it lacks in sophistication it makes up for in authenticity and price. Two pieces of meat will fill a light eater; bigger appetites will need double. Portions are modest, the rice a little dry, and yes, the morning glory can be salty. But the pork is smoky, slightly sweet, perfectly seasoned, and grilled over coals with just the right char.

The space is simple. The first floor is hot, with no air conditioning, just fans doing their best. The second floor has AC, barely enough to escape the tropical heat, but it’s a relief for those who don’t want to melt mid-meal. Staff are kind and fast, and the owners are a cheerful husband-and-wife team who make you feel welcome even if you can’t speak a word of Vietnamese.

Drinks aren’t always cold, ice melts fast, and hygiene is local standard—not perfect, but not alarming. It’s a tourist magnet now, thanks to YouTube and Google Maps, but mostly it’s a neighbourhood spot where locals pick up takeout or settle in for a quick lunch. Spring rolls are serviceable, soups are simple, but the core dish—pork rib rice—is consistent, cheap, and genuinely satisfying. The sweet-and-salty sauce on the table elevates every bite, and yes, the morning glory is worth ordering.

If you’re craving a genuine Vietnamese pork rib rice bowl that hits the sweet spot of smoky, salty, and comforting, this small shop on Yên Bái Street is worth a stop. Forget expectations, embrace the heat, and order two pieces of pork. Then thank yourself for discovering Da Nang’s simple, smoky, undeniable flavour.",4,4,3,,,,2025-09-28,2025-10-05

the things worth mentioning, they're a bit too heavy on the MSG which really takes away from the light crisp flavor of all of their items.  a true shame that would kick them up to a strong 4.  really would be a very great meal as they don't go heavy on sugars like the Com Tam restaurants in America, in the touristy or fancy spots tend to lean on.

other thing worth noting, if you arrive later in the night, they'll simply put your meal together from all precooked items from earlier that evening.  so you'll be lacking that hot meal.  another reason, likely this is due to Da Nang being so hot, locals may actually prefer food that is room temperature so I wouldn't necessarily say it's right or wrong.",3,3,3,Dine in,Dinner,,2025-09-05,2025-10-05

The grilled pork chop is the star of the show: tender, juicy, and charred just right for that authentic smoky flavor. Their egg meatloaf (chả trứng) and shredded pork skin (bì) are also solid choices, full of texture and traditional taste. The broken rice itself is fluffy and perfectly cooked, soaking up the savory, slightly sweet nước mắm like a sponge.

Portions are generous, prices are affordable, and the service is fast and friendly. The dining area is clean and casual, great for a quick lunch or dinner. Locals frequent this spot, which is always a good sign.

=====================

▫️Taken together:

It's exactly like the charcoal-grilled pork ribs we know.

They grill them over charcoal right after you order,
and the pork ribs are served on a round white plate with rice atop them. They're absolutely delicious.

I wonder if Korea offers something like this?

The price is reasonable, but I think the adult menu item 8 (2 pieces of ribs + extra fries) is better. Or you could add rice.

There's no air conditioning, but it's clean, and the vegetable soup that comes with it looks like something I've had before. It's delicious.

I found this local restaurant by searching the area on Google Maps.
The price is cheap and the main dish seems to be pork + egg rice bowl? When you order, meat the size of an adult's palm is grilled and comes out, which is a perfect Korean pork ribs and japchae. It doesn't have the unique Southeast Asian spices, so even the kids like it.
My two picky kids ordered meat 4 or 5 times.
You can add pork or egg separately, so keep that in mind.

The atmosphere is exactly the kind of visual that locals would eat in and eat. My style.

Cons: The kids keep insisting on eating here, so it's embarrassing.",5,5,5,Dine in,Dinner,Korean,2025-01-05,2025-10-05

Before, they used to cook it right away..
But now, they just cook it in a container and take it out..

Of course, considering the price, it's local,
so there's merit!
But there were so many flies flying around ㅠㅠㅠ
First of all, it was so hot that I inhaled it while sweating.

And
when locals ordered the same menu,
they brought out a couple more side dishes.
But when Koreans ordered,
it was a little^^; simple..ㅎㅎ

3. The food was excellent, giving it a 5-star rating for its value.
I had a rice bowl called ""Com Tam"" and morning glory, which were slightly lower than the more expensive places I've had in Hoi An. The stems were larger, so the taste was a bit chewy. Those who prefer a crisper texture might enjoy it. Of the three morning glory I had during my three-day trip, this was the best, considering the value.
It was my first time eating ""Com Tam,"" so I can't compare, but the taste was good, and considering the value, I was very satisfied. They also have tea, which is a nice alternative to water.

5 dishes...
It has pros and cons. First, it's not cooked to order, but rather pre-cooked ribs, sausages, fried eggs, etc., and they're served to you when you order.
The advantage is that it comes out quickly. The disadvantage is that it's not hot and cold.
The ribs have a familiar sweet and sour taste.
The jjajangmyeon looks delicious, but it was cold, which was disappointing.
The omelet is the same omelet with meat! Haha
There's also something called Chinese sausage,
but if you think of it as typical Korean sausage, it might not suit your taste.
The kimchi... I'll just call it pickled vegetables! Haha.

If you think it's a famous restaurant in Da Nang, you might be a little disappointed...
If you're staying at a hotel without breakfast, it seems like a good breakfast.

The places I ate in other cities had slightly bigger and thicker meat than here. Personally, I think eating banh mi is a better choice.

About 7 out of 10? I'd give it a score of 10.

Still, it was clean and it was nice to see two young brothers working.

🏡 Ba Lang broken rice - 120 Yen Bai ⏰ 9am - 8pm
💰 25k - 50k
🌟 4/5
-------------------------------------------------
🌸 Broken rice is a very popular dish 💪 I went at noon, the restaurant was quite crowded, suitable for eating with family 🙆
🌸 I ordered 2 plates of ribs + fried egg 35k/plate. A plate includes rice, 1 piece of ribs, 1 fried egg, cabbage, cucumber. The rice is loose, a bit dry in some places. The ribs are marinated with rich flavor, soft. The fried egg is cooked without being fried 😂 The dipping sauce is delicious, eating with rice is delicious. Overall, I think it's delicious 💪
🌸 Prices range from 25 - 50k. The vendors are also friendly 😊
If you want to change the taste every now and then, eat Southern-style broken rice, you guys 🤣! This restaurant is quite crowded, so I was curious to try it. The sweet taste is quite similar to Saigon. A normal plate of grilled ribs is 25k, the plate I ate was ribs - egg rolls - fried egg for 35k. The ribs here are grilled directly when eaten, they are also quite large, not dry at all so the meat is sweet, as for the rice, it is real broken rice, so I quite like it. What I like most here is the sweet and sour fish sauce. Every time I eat broken rice, I often ask for an extra bowl of scallion oil to mix with the fish sauce, when poured over the rice, it has a sweet and sour taste mixed with the fatty taste of the scallion, eating rice alone is also enjoyable 🤣🤣🤣 that's how Fin eats broken rice",,,,,,Vietnamese,2020-10-05,2025-10-05

I went during lunch time and the meat was lukewarm.
The rice is like Annam rice used for fried rice.
The combination of meat, eggs, and vegetables is okay, but the taste is just bland.ㅋ It's a little better if you sprinkle some sauce on it, but it still feels like something is missing.ㅋ
I have a sensitive stomach, so if there's bad hygiene, I react right away, but this is the first time I've been to Da Nang and I went to the bathroom right after eatingㅋ
I don't think it's a place you should go out of your way to eat.

If you are concerned about cleanliness, freshness, hygiene, and Instagram photos, don't go.. If you want to try the real local style pork rib rice bowl, you should definitely go. The taste is guaranteed. There is also a Korean menu.
